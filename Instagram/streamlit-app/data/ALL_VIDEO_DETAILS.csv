In this video, I share my findings on whether you should learn Python to become a data analyst.  For this, I used Python to scrape LinkedIn job postings for data analysts to analyze what skills are being requested of entry-level data analysts.  Surprisingly enough, it is neither Python nor R as the most requested skill!?!

Tim's work focused on simulating asteroid collisions and understanding the possible impacts that these could have on planet habitability. 

Before entering data science, he attended a data science boot camp in Chicago called metis. He believes that these could be helpful for some people entering the field, but not for everyone. 

I talk with Tim about his expectations about data science versus reality, and about how his previous experience have made him successful in the field. 

We also talk at length about what someone who is new to data science should do to achieve success in their first position in the field.

In this video I relive my regrets as a data science student in hopes that you all wont make the same learning mistakes that I did. Even having made mistakes, I think I turned out pretty good, so definitely don't be afraid to try new things!

Data Science Projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBDiadC8BvE&ab_channel=KenJee

1) Coding - Choose a language Python or R and stick with it. I think it is better to start of learning one well than dividing your time. When you do this you learn about ""how programming languages work"" and you don't get as confused with pure syntax.

2) Dive into challenging topics - I avoided a few hard classes till the end of my degree. It turns out I would have greatly benefited from taking them earlier on

3) Consider all options when learning. You don't necessarily need an expensive masters degree to break into the field. I racked up a ton of student debt, and don't recommend it! 365 data science is a great option, also this is a link to my favorite free resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4&ab_channel=KenJee

4) Internships & Research - I really focused hard on my grades. In the long run they didn't matter as much as my data science internships and potential research opportunities. 

5) Clubs & Groups - I wish I had made friends with people that had similar interests as me. You can do this on the #66DaysOfData discord server: https://discord.gg/BRv6YGb

3BEtGaz70rQ,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"In this video I walk through my analysis about where the NBA 3-point line should be to maximize fairness in the game. This is based on the work of Kirk Goldsberry in his book Sprawlball (link below). 

#DataScience #SportsAnalytics #DataScienceProjects #Basketball
The three point shot has changed the incentive structure within the game of basketball. Players get more points per shot for 3 pointers and for shots at the rim than on any shot in the mid-range. Mid range jumpers used to be a staple of the game, now they are becoming a relic.

As players shoot more threes, the plays that teams employ have begun to shift. The type of players that they are filling their rosters out with are changing as well.

It is hard to become a data scientist, yet it is still possible! There is a lot to learn and it takes a specific mindset to accumulate the skills. 

*Disclaimer: I have created multiple courses with 365 data science. I believe in their product, but also believe other platforms are very suitable for learning the domain. This is not a paid video though. Below is my personal discount code for 365 ds.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Tina's Channel For Next Week's Episode: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww

Tips 
- Make sure that your resume is a single page 
- Try to quantify your work and data science projects 
- Think of your resume as a highlight reel, you want to include only things that are important for the job at hand 
- Do your research and look at what skills job postings are asking for 
- Include relevant work experience above project experience

2qVWurPFwfc,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Is Data Science Dying?,"In this video I analyze if data science is dying. I address (1) is it trending downward? (2) Will it be automated and (3) Will there be jobs available? 

I've gotten quite a few versions of similar questions: Is data science dying? Is the data science job market saturated? Is it too late to get into data science?

This is my (somewhat) thorough answer to these questions. 

One of the main articles that kicked off this conversation: https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-death-of-the-data-scientist

1:03 Is data science trending up or down?
2:36 Will data science be automated by AI?
5:31 Will the data science job market be oversaturated?

These 5 projects are bound to turn heads. Some of these projects may be considered ""unusual"" but they can land you a job if they land in front of the right person.  I have been doing quite a few project reviews lately, and these are some of the things that really stood out to me. 

1) Scraped data with an exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2) A web application to host your project
3) A project designed for others to use (Docker or Kubernetes)
4) A collaborative project
5) A data science project using embedded devices or low powered AI

I don't want new people out of college or changing careers to have unrealistic expectations when trying to become a Data Analyst. It's hard enough to get an entry level job, but if you have the expectation that 84k starting is normal then you are going to be very disappointed.

Many people are interested in working in data science, have the technical skills, but don't meet the work experience requirements set by most companies. The following are my ways to circumvent this:

#DataScience #DataScienceExperience #DataScienceJobs #DataScienceCareers
1) Research opportunities at your university
2) Working on personal projects that you share with your community 
3) School projects / Schoolwork 
4) Internship work 
5) Contracting websites (Upwork, etc.)
6) Work for free at a non-profit or local business

vaD3ZFFNwhM,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,How to learn SQL for data science interview (the minimize effort maximize outcome way),"This is a step by step guide for how I learned SQL for my FANG data science interview. I had never touched SQL before and only had 2 weeks to prepare for my interview. So I made a scientifically-backed study plan to learn SQL most efficiently with the least amount of time and effort. By the end of the 11 days, I felt super confident and prepared. I went on to pass my FANG data science interviews and got the job! 

My motto: Minimize effort and maximize outcome!!

Btw apologies about audio quality from about 2  - 3.5 min mark. Something weird happened to my mic :(

hpMc6TgT34I,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,The 5 Stages of Learning Data Science,"In this video I talk about how to progress through the 5 stages of learning data science. I will talk about my data science journey and how I ""leveled up"" from one stage to the next. 

Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1

Stage 1: Unconscious Incompetence (Novice Data Scientist) - In this stage the field may seem relatively easy. After watching some youtube videos and learning some python or r basics, you will learn how large the field of data science is. 

Free data science course recommendations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4

Stage 2: Conscious Incompetence (Overwhelmed) - In this stage you will begin to understand the different elements of programming and statistics. Most people get stuck here because they don't know where to start. To get to the next stage, you should narrow the boundaries and start with a small data science project. Learn the necessary skills to complete that task, then move on to another small one. You should also go on kaggle and review code of other data scientists. Keep a log of all the terms, algorithms, and packages that you don't know.

Stage 3: Conscious Competence (Slightly Dangerous) - Here you will have had a few projects under your belt. You will now be able to reuse your python or r code. This is where you truly learn data science. You should do as many projects as you can and learn to code data science algorithms from scratch. 

Stage 4: Unconscious Competence (Art Form) - At this stage, you know how to solve problems as they come along. You don't have to refer to your data science scripts, and you can start focusing on producing results. Here, you start to focus on optimizing your models.

Stage 5: Mastery (Contribution) - While I don't believe that anyone has mastered data science, I believe that you reach this data science learning stage by contributing to the field in a meaningful way. There are few people that reach this stage, and most of them are likely living in academia.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

There are very few college students that land Data Science Jobs right out of school. These are my tips to maximize your university experience and to give you the best career options going forward. 

1) Get as much experience as you can. You can do this through data science internships, projects, or research with your professors. 
2) It doesn't matter what you study if you are comfortable with going back to grad school. If you don't want to go back to school and still want to work in data science, you should study CS, Physics, Math, Statistics, or some other quantitative discipline. 
3) Use your professor's free time. These people have dedicated their lives to their given field and you should learn from them as much as you can. 
4) Use your school network as much as possible. 
5) Do data science projects that interest you and share them. 
6) Join data science clubs or start them. 
7) Go to conferences at the student rate. 
8) Don't stress about it.

Tina's video on getting the YouTube Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YaIegbrq5o&ab_channel=TinaHuang

The goal is to take the engagement leaderboard that I made for my youtube subscribers and make it into a tool that other creators can use. We have to go through and make a TON of upgrades. First we have to figure out how to get the YouTube API to work for other YouTubers, not just myself. Next we have to build out a new software infrastructure.

For this project we decided to use the MERN software engineering stack (Mongo DB, Express, React, Node). This is all pretty new to us, so it should be a good learning adventure. 

In the upcoming videos, we will take you on the journey with us to building this platform. Forrest will work as the main software engineer on the team, Tina will work as the data scientist, and I will wear the project manager hat! 

I hope you enjoy!

KMOA5arCi8g,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,What I Learned From My Three Degrees,"In this video I talk about what I learned during my college degree, my masters in global commerce, and in my masters in computer science. I also speak to how these relate to my work in data science.

In my economics degree, I learned to see the world in trends and numbers. This changed my way of thinking from my highschool days and set the groundwork for learning data science.

In my first masters degree, I learned how to tell a story and understand a business. I wanted to get into management consulting, so I learned business strategy and entrepreneurship. I also learned some SQL and basic R programming. 

In my masters in Computer Science, I concentrated in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I learned Python, R, Scala, Java, C and a few other programming languages. I also learned software engineering principles, how databases work, and networking principles.

All of this education worked for me, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this path for everyone. If you are a self starter, I suggest trying to self study instead. The quality of the content on the internet is as good as any university taught data science course. 

If I could go back and do it again, I would have started on a more technical path. I also would have leveraged the networks that I developed.

7O4dpR9QMIM,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"This is part 5 of the Data Science Project from Scratch series. In this video I try a few different models to try to predict the glassdoor salary data that we collected in part 2, cleaned in part 3, and explored in part 4 of this series. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

When people think about data science, model building is what they usually think about. In this phase, we try multiple different data science algorithms to see which one performs the best. We tune each of these algorithms, and often try multiple at a time to see if we can produce a more accurate result. 

Here, I try a multiple linear regression, a lasso regression, and a random forest regressor. 

I chose to do a lasso regression because the data is fairly sparse, and we would expect a normalized model to perform better. I also selected a random forest because we had many dummy variables. With this type of data, we would also expect a tree based model to perform well. 

Please stay tuned for part 6 where we productionize this model.

k4r_NtB4JVQ,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Golf: Would You Rather Be the LONGEST or STRAIGHTEST Driver on the PGA Tour?,"This video is intended to help the average golf fan understand the trade-off between distance and accuracy at the highest level of golf. Is it better to be longer or straighter?
#DataScience #SportsAnalytics #GolfAnalyltics 
Every Shot Counts: https://amzn.to/2QOPDRC

I compare Cameron Champ, Keegan Bradley and Chez Reavie in this video. My goal is to understand which player you would rather have drive the ball for you given that your approach game is that of an average PGA Tour player.

To do this, we need to understand the probability that players hit the ball into areas other than the fairway and the expected strokes from each distance and location. 

I compare the expected score per hole for each of these players for the average par 4 on the PGA tour (~430 yards). I also compare the scoring for varying hole lengths. 

I found that Cameron Champ holds the advantage in all hole lengths, but his advantage grows as the holes get longer. 

In most circumstances, you would want the longer driver; however, there are a few cases where this isn't so. (1) When an individual player is better from a longer range than a shorter range (2) when the golf course is particularly penal to misses in the rough or has a high instance of out of play or penalty shots off the tee. 

The strokes gained baselines that are used are from the every shot counts book (2014) so they may not be representative of players on the current PGA Tour.

It's about learning, coding, and generally how to get your sh*t together c: 

I've been a FAANG data scientist for over a year now. While that's not a lot of time, I've had the amazing opportunity to work with super star data scientists, be mentored by them, and even start mentoring more junior data scientists! I've learned a lot about what it actually means to be a data scientist. In this video, I talk about why you should not be a data scientist.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

smeFkHwnM_k,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Welcome To My Channel | Ken Jee | Data Science,"On my channel I provide data science content that can make the field more accessible and enjoyable to everyone. 

I create videos about how to get into data science, what it is like to work as a data scientist, how to be productive, and my own personal projects. 

I currently work as a data science manager at a sports analytics consulting company. I have also held positions in management consulting and as a data scientist. 

I have masters degrees in global commerce and computer science. Hopefully my unique insight into business and technical problems enhances your data science understanding. 

Thank you!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

rLawTH--l2Y,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 19 (One Big Improvement),"In this video I review one Deepak's data science portfolio, data science projects, resume, github and linkedin. Special thanks to him for letting me review his work!

Deepak is solid in all areas, but it is really missing a personal touch. He also needs to communicate the value of his work more clearly.

Resume:
- Want to expand on algorithmic techniques 
- Put performance up first 
- Work experience above projects
- Great data science hackathon experience is not included in the resume (not in video)

Github:
- Use grammar conventions of the countries you are applying in 
- Go beyond just what the accuracy of the model. Talk about the value that is created from working on the data science project 
- On your personal website and linkedin, talk more about yourself and your interests

Kq9dkZu0bpg,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,"Hedge Funds, Startups, and Data Science Oh my! (@DataLeap) - KNN EP. 14","In this video I had the pleasure of speaking with Andrew from dataleap. He is data scientist and youtuber who is providing a great resource free industry education. He breaks down complex data science concepts with his own unique brand of comedy sprinkled in. You also get to enjoy some corgi time with his wonderful sidekick meatball.

In college, Andrew was grinding for an 80 hour a week job as a management consultant. He had never written a line of code until his junior year. During his masters when he found out about the great opportunities in data science, he was able to teach himself the skills and land a job in just six months.  Since then he's bounced around a lot of industries: from cutting edge startups, to billion dollar hedge funds and FAANG companies. Each time he swapped roles, he was able to increase his base compensation and the amount of freedom in his work.  

In this video, we will talk about how he learned the skills, how he conquered the interview process, and how maybe you can follow in his footsteps. After the video, if you want to learn more about Andrew, check out his youtube channel which I have linked in the description and pinned in the first comment.

#66DaysOfData Discord Server - https://discord.gg/BRv6YGb

Data science is a marathon, not a sprint. The 66days of data is an initiative I started to help people create the proper habits for learning data science for the long term. Now how do you actually do that?

The initiative has two parts. First, you need to study data science 66 days straight for at least 5 minutes per day. Second, you need to share what you learned each day on your favorite social platform! This helps you to build proper habits & accountability that you will need on your data science journey! 

I will be starting round 3 of this initiative July 1 along with other creators @statquest  &  @DataProfessor

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

jp-Lv_3a2VI,UCLLw7jmFsvfIVaUFsLs8mlQ,Luke Barousse,Google vs IBM Data Analyst Certificate - BEST Certificate for Data Analysts,"Google Data Analytics Certificate  👉🏼  https://lukeb.co/GoogleCert
IBM Data Analyst Certificate 👉🏼  https://lukeb.co/IBMDataCert

Is either the Google Data Analytics or IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate right for you? Both of these are two of the most popular options for those wanting to become a data analyst.  For this video I cover similarities and differences between the two certificate programs and finally move into my recommendation on which certificate is better for you.

Data Science - An ensemble field that combines aspects of statistics, computer science, and information science. Data science involves data manipulation (SQL / NOSQL), descriptive analysis, and advanced analysis (ML techniques)

Machine Learning - A subset of data science. This focuses mainly on two types of algorithms. Supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning usually refers to classification and regression problem, while unsupervised learning relates to feature reduction or clustering algorithms. 

Artificial Intelligence - Barrows from some parts of machine learning, but a portion of it sits outside of data science or ML. There are generally two types specialized intelligence and generalized intelligence. Specialized intelligence focuses on replicating human decision making in a small feature space. Generalized intelligence aims to recreate the entirety of the human decision making process.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Andrew's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC23emuGbNM7twofQIrEgPBQ

This video is satire and not meant to be taken seriously. All of these comments are caricatures and are to poke subtle fun at our own careers as data scientists. 

Enjoy!

Hey y'all let's create a vision board/book together for 2022 and beyond and plan out our goals to achieve them :) Livestream will follow the format as I outlined in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deIUUboTeig so please check it out if you have a chance :) 

Also to get the most of the session I would recommend getting a notebook and/board (if you're creating a vision board), scissors, glue stick, markers, and other things to decorate with. You can always do this later but if you have the chance please do also print out pictures that represent your vision and/or find some magazines with visuals of your dreams that you can cut out and paste 🐈🐈

This is going to be a super chill workshop and chatting session :) So excited!",2021-12-28T03:38:05Z,[],23234,941,26,PT2H18M33S,hd,false,public,True,False

I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

fhi4dOhmW-g,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"This is part 3 of the Data Science Project from Scratch Series. In this video I go through how to clean up your data to make it usable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Data cleaning is an extremely important and often overlooked step in the data science lifecycle. Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach.

The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves.

I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features. 

Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

I wanted to take the time to thank everyone for their support. Every subscriber, every view and every comment encourages me to continue making videos. 

I started this channel as a challenge to myself. I wanted to improve my speaking and my understanding of data science. I had no idea that so many people would watch my videos. I hope that everything that I have produced has been interesting and useful to those who have watched it. 

Going forward, I plan to continue to produce weekly content. I will be creating videos about the general data science field, data science projects, and will be continuing my data science fundamentals series. I will also include some interviews and code reviews.

Thank you again for watching, and good luck on your data science journey!

#DataScience #TwitterScraper #WebScraping

This module is great because it does not require you to get an API key from twitter. It also lets you go back beyond the 2 week paywall  that twitter has.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

How I learned GIT 👉🏼  https://lukeb.co/GitDataCamp

In this video, we cover one of my favorite tools to use as a data analyst: Git (with GitHub).  Git is a version control system that allows you to track your changes when working on your project.  GitHub is an online platform that allows you to host your files and also the central git repository.  As a data analyst, this is an excellent tool to know not only to be able to collaborate on teams but also to share your portfolio with others.

DopikusDfk0,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Collision Course: Sports Betting + Data Science,"In this video I talk about the impending collision between sports betting and data science. Sports betting is fascinating for many reasons. First, you only need to have a slightly greater than 50% edge to make money (~53%). Second, sports books are locally efficient but the global market is inefficient. Finally, betting lines can move; if you can predict the way that they will move, you can maximize the odds in your favor.

Today we look at some SQL Interview Questions. The first questions we look at are Phone interview questions which are generally more broad questions. Then we look at In-Person interview questions which are typically more technical and specific. 

You may get some technical questions during your interview or none at all! It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.

I hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!

#DataScience #DataScienceJobs #DataScienceCareers

Questions to Ask Yourself:
- Am I prepared to seriously commit to learning? Data Science has a steep learning curve. You also have to invest in learning after getting a job or finishing school.

- Can you identify problems and seek out solutions? People will not tell you how to solve every problem. You have to be creative enough to identify problems and generate custom solutions to them

- Do you have an aptitude for math? The foundation of data science is in math. You need to be comfortable with this to excel in the field.

- Are you interested in computer science and programming? Most day to day data science work requires programming. You must be comfortable learning these techniques. 

- Do you have a knack for story telling and explaining complex concepts in simple terms? You commonly have to explain your findings to business holders. If you cannot put your findings in their terms, they will likely not use your work.

In almost every data science interview I have had, I have talked about at least one of these projects. 

Data science project 1: Basketball season win total prediction 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_SMU701qlA
Data science project 2:  RNN to predict the price of crypto currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfRhKHV8-t4
Data science project 3: UFC decision classifier
Data science project 4: Golfer cluster analysis 

As you can see, all of these data science projects were on subjects interesting to me. While not all of them were successful, I was able to articulate their pitfalls and was able to clearly explain the possible next steps. I was also extremely focused on the outcome and who would be using the research.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

6tQtwqthUMI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,My First Data Science Contracting Side-Gig (How I Did It),"In this video I talk about how I landed my first data science contracting side-gig. It is hard to land your first client, and I think my story could help you get started with data science freelancing. 

I personally didn't use a website like upwork or fiver to get my first data science contract. I used good old-fashioned networking. 

key takeaways for landing a data science contract 
1) Play the long game, these relationships are built incrementally
2) Network and meet people 
3) Build a track record
4) Seek to understand the other person's view of data science and analytics. What are their pain points? What are their goals?
5) Give free advice and work. Become a trusted advisor.
6) Follow up and make it as easy as possible for them to hire you.

9ZwVqXUHf6o,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,When Data Science Goes Wrong,"In this video, I talk about what happens when data science or machine learning goes wrong. I get many of the examples from the book ""Weapons of Math Destruction"" by Cathy O'Neil.

Book: https://amzn.to/2w1eJVy

Even well intentioned data science models can have negative consequences. Take the college ranking system for example. This system was designed to evaluate the quality of schools, and evaluated them across a host of different metrics. One thing that was not considered was the cost of attendance. Universities spent billions of dollars to improve their rankings, and this was reflected in tuition rates. This model lacked an extremely important input and thus caused a major incentive problem.

Another example is social media. Companies are doing their best to keep you on their platforms with notifications, likes, etc. This can have an addictive impact as well. The algorithms are doing their job, but we are getting addicted to our phones and devices. 

A third example comes from the news. News companies want as much  interaction with their articles as possible. Unfortunately, the articles that get the most engagement are the ones that are controversial and sensationalist. These machine learning models promote these types of articles because that its what they are trained to do. 

It is our responsibility as data scientists to make sure our models are used for good and don't have negative unintended consequences. You can do this by getting user feedback, re-training and evaluating, and testing your models continuously on real world data.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

I hope to help cut through the ambiguity associated with plagiarism in data science by clearly defining it, talking about how you can avoid it in your data science projects, and about some of the negative consequences associated with it. 

This is a cautionary tale. Plagiarism can have disastrous consequences, like for my fellow youtuber Siraj Raval. I hope that we can learn from others mistakes and avoid this type of behavior in the future.

In this video I break down what people mean by business skills and I also show you where to learn them! 

Ok, so what are business skills for technical people really? I polled my Linkedin Audience to see what some thought leaders in the space thought. Link: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kenjee_datascience-business-activity-6842569519211393024-xSLS/

From my personal experience and research I found that business skills generally fall into a few broad categories: Understanding the business model of your company, Problem definition, Time Management / Project Estimation, Presenting & Conveying information, and Networking. 

The places that I learned many of these skills (I still definitely need improvement) are:
1) Books
2) Sitting in on calls and meetings
3) Projects
4) Formal Courses 
5) Asking questions to communities on linkedin etc. 

Books I mentioned:

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

-zbLpoJVBMI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,What the Heck is WSL 2? (My New Favorite Tool),"In this video I show you what WSL 2 is and how I use it for my data science workflow. This tool has completely changed how I do my work both as a data scientist and as a content creator. 

Install WSL 2 here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Based on a poll I ran a few months ago, the vast majority of you aren't familiar with what WSL 2 is. Today I'm going to explain what exactly windows subsystem for linux 2 is and why it can be useful to you as a data scientist.

WSL2 lets me do is use both operating systems on the same computer without having to dual boot. Essentially, I can open a linux terminal on my windows machine, use all the linux commands, and have virtually all the same benefits of both windows and linux. Also… it is free, I know I’m going to be getting that question a lot in the comments.

WSL2 lets you use access the same file system from both windows and linux. To me, this is a massive deal. If I’m making a tutorial, say with NVIDIA’s RAPIDS that only works on linux, I can do the coding, record the screen, and edit the video all without switching between computers or turning them off and on. 

This also opens up a huge suite of tools for you to use. For example, if wanted to explore data using one of the most popular BI tools out there, you wouldn’t have to figure out how to configure them on linux. This makes your work and your options more flexible. 

0:00 Intro
0:44 What is WSL 2?
1:10 Why is this a big deal?
3:05 How does it perform?
3:45 What about data science?
4:10 My favorite part
5:05 Why this could be great for you!

lsXWVPzwZPk,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"In this video I critique my own data science resume. I walk you through some of the things that I do well and also some of the major problems with how I have put my data science resume together. Special thanks to Pranath for pointing out some of these errors! 

Resume Link: https://kennethjee.com/resume/

Things that I did well:
- Links up top 
- Exhaustive list of skills up top 
- Clear structure focused on work experience 

Thinks I did poorly:
- Grammatical errors (Unacceptable)
- Picture at the top
- Lack of projects and coursework 
- Poorly communicated project value 

Things I did that you shouldn't: 
- Picture on resume 
- Additional formatting
- Focus on management experience 

My resume is mostly decorative and would be focused more on a senior level or director level job. I recommend against using my resume as a template!

Lesson 1 - Don't evaluate your performance against others. Often we compare results even though the inputs are wildly different. You may think you're bad at something even though the people you are comparing yourself have practiced 5x more. Everyone starts as a beginner on this journey. 

Lesson 2 - Develop a growth mindset. One of the most important steps of learning to learn is realizing you are capable of growth. Proving to yourself that you can get better over time is immeasurably powerful. 

Lesson 3 - Find your motivation through purpose (or something close to it). Purpose can be hard to find, it takes tremendous introspection to cultivate this calling. Still, once you find yourself there, you will have all the motivation you need to reach your goals.
 
Lesson 4 - Change your identity. In order to make true change, you have to become the change you want to embody. Talk to yourself like you're someone who is capable and you will become capable. 

Lesson 5 - Find Flow. There are certain criteria that can be met to achieve deep focus. Understand how you focus and unleash your new found superpower onto the world. 

Lesson 6 - Develop the learning skillset. Reading, organizing information, etc. are needed to learn at a high level. Understand the science of learning to unlock this potential.

Lesson 7 - Develop consistency through habits. We can take off the burden if we have good habits. Habits give structure to our lives and allow us to organize information. They also can make difficult tasks seemingly effortless. 

Lesson 8 - Do Projects.

AxP1CL0yaFQ,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"In this video I talk about if you should learn R for Data Science. 

In general, R is most useful in medical and research fields. R is good for building interactive visuals (R Shiny), and may have some modules that are superior to those in Python.

On the other hand. Python has better documentation and is more flexible as a programming language. 

You may not have to learn R at all if you know python. You can see the below reference guides that show you how to translate python code to R and vice versa. There are also some modules that allow you to use python directly in the R kernel. 

Pandas to R Methods: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_r.html

2KkrtG5IsHo,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 11(GITHUB CLEANING),"In this video I review the data science projects in Shivam's github profile. Special thanks to him for submitting his work! 

Shivam is very active on github which is a good thing. Still, his github profile could use some maintenance. He has some repos that are empty and should be deleted. He could also benefit from improved naming conventions and project descriptions. 

One of my favorite projects that he does is he coded a Nerual Net from scratch. This is an awesome project that shows his genuine interest in how the data science models work. This isn't something that I look for, but it is definitely a positive to have. This isn't a data science project that would supplement for one done with actual data, but it is still very strong. 

For Shivam, I recommend that he build a portfolio website to showcase specific projects or use a github profile header like Import Data shows in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_RDoNJ1zGg

Machine learning projects I recommend doing: At least 1 on regression, classification, clustering. An additional project on deep learning, computer vision, or NLP.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

KQ80oD_boBM,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Follow along here: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/kaggle-project-from-scratch ! This is Part 2 of my kaggle project from scratch series where I analyze the kaggle data science developer survey data. 

In this video I show you how I approach data cleaning, data manipulation, and some light Exploratory data analysis. This video is meant to focus more on my process than the actual coding or results. I also use plotly for this project which is a tool I was previously unfamiliar with. I show you how I learn by getting my hands dirty. 

Part 1: https://youtu.be/r-DR9HBaipU

From a technical perspective, I do the following:
- Outline my analysis 
- load in and briefly explore the data 
- Check for null values 
- Organize the data so that it can be easily used to create charts 
- Create some basic charts with plotly express and plotly go
- Organize the data so that it can be segmented by profession 
- Build one ""advanced visual"" showing you the 4 iterations that it took me to get there. 

Resources I used:
- https://plotly.com/python/histograms/
- https://plotly.com/python/heatmaps/
- https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59406167/plotly-how-to-filter-a-pandas-dataframe-using-a-dropdown-menu

And a drink! It's a Japanese strawberry milk drink I got at Hmart. You should watch this video if you are interested in useful resume tips and Japanese strawberry milk drinks.This is a resume review series where I review a resume and an Asian snack/drink. I say it is to spice things up a little, but tbh it's also a little because I have to justify why I'm buying so many Asian snacks/drinks. ENJOY!

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

aaAZXeuPIXk,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),"#DataScience #KenJee #SportsAnalytics #AstrosCheatingScandal

The Code: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/Astros_Analysis
http://signstealingscandal.com/
https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/baseball/stats.html#V.1.8.0.1.0.0.2009.2018
https://www.playingnumbers.com/2020/02/did-cheating-really-help-the-astros-win/

In this video I walk through my analysis of the Astros Cheating scandal. From the data that Tony Adams collected, I look at the correlation between the number of trash can bangs and the number of runs scored. I also use a linear regression and a logistic regression to determine if trash can bangs have predictive power over runs and wins. 

Shockingly the correlation and linear regression suggested that there was very little relationship between bangs and runs scored. The logistic regression also suggested that bangs were not a predictor of wins. I was shocked by this, but I knew that I had to look deeper.

After additional analysis, I found that the number of bangs in losses were significantly greater than the number in wins. If the Astros were mainly cheating when they were behind, this would likely not show in the models we built before. I also looked at the number of bangs in games when the Astros were down early. I found that there is a large spike in bangs when they are down in the first 3 innings. 

To see if this had a meaningful impact, I looked at their win % for games when they were behind by inning. I found that they greatly outperformed the average team when this was the case.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

0:00 Intro
0:42 Is it Possible to Learn Data Science?
1:33 Where to Start Learning
2:33 How to Create a Learning Map
3:55 What Would My Learning Plan Look Like?
5:28 Before You Start with Projects...
7:05 Statistics???
7:45 Project Obsession
9:00 How to Leverage Projects Effectively
10:14  How Long Will This Take?
10:48 An Important Note on Goals

Starting off, I want to debunk the idea that you can “learn data science”. This implies that data science is a static subject that can be learned in its entirety. For better or for worse, data science is constantly evolving and growing. I don’t know a single person including myself, that could possibly know the whole field. Learning data science is a journey not a destination, and coming in with this mindset can make this process far more enjoyable for you. 

First, I would start with a learning map. You need to plan your learning journey. Next, I would start learning python. You need to understand the basics here. After that, I highly recommend looking at other peoples projects and work. Finally, focus on data science projects to engrain new topics!

Kaggle and github are the two many ways that you can showcase your work as a data scientist or aspiring data scientist. You also constantly hear me blabbering about how valuable each of these platforms are. In this video, I will compare the two platforms to determine which is the best place for you to host your data science portfolio on. 

Kaggle is arguably the largest data science community out there. It started as a place where people could go to compete against each other in data science competitions. It still has these competitions, but now it has evolved into a one stop shop for data science learning, awesome datasets, and engaged forum. On Kaggle, you have a profile where you can earn rankings for sharing your work and placing well in competitions. 

Github, on the other hand, is more focused on function. Github is one of the hosting platforms for the versioning control system called git. Git allows you and your team to keep track of the changes in your code. This can be extremely valuable when you have multiple people working on a project. Git has also evolved into a place where you keep and maintain all of the code that you write. Many developers use their github profile & repositories as a living documentation for all they have done. 

Kaggle:
+ Simple Reward System
+ Great Community 
+ Discoverability
+ Clear Focus on Data Science 
- Limited ways to share 
- limited in the skills you can showcase 

Github:
+Shows you know GIT
+ Highlights Documentation
+ Illustrates More Diverse Skillset 
+ More Flexibility
-More difficult to use
-Greater time commitment 
- Additional skills like git & markdown

There have been tremendous leaps in technology in the last few years, we have the capabilities to do data science on our phones and other mobile devices.

For data science, you generally need a python environment. Google google colaboratory (aka google colab), allows you to run a python instance through the browser of your phone. It also has the necessary python libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc.) already installed. 

If you want to learn data science on your mobile device, you have many options as well. You can go to your respective app store and find many coding and data science apps. You also have access to udemy, coursera, edx and many other online learning platforms. 

If you prefer books, you can download the kindle app and read them on your phone. You can also buy books and follow along in your mobile google colab environment.

0:00 Intro 
0:45 Balance is a Myth
2:35 ELIMINATION
4:54 Hyper-prioritization 
8:10 Economies of Scope 
9:08 HELP!
10:33 Make it Leisure
11:39 Design Your Life

When I first started doing YouTube, each video took me almost 20 hours to make. It was almost impossible for me to make videos, keep up with my data science learning, and do a solid job with my work. Over the last two years I started to crack the code to balancing YouTube, my work, and my leisure time. These are the ultra super secret techniques that I use to stay on top of things. 

1) Balance - I personally think that life balance is a myth. Let me clarify. I think balance on a day to day basis is unrealistic. Being able to fit work, leisure, health, family, spirituality, and whatever else matters to you into every single day would really stress me out. On the other hand, over the course of months or years I am certain you can find balance across multiple areas of your life. I find that focusing on long term balance (particularly weekly or monthly), is something that has allowed me to manage my time effectively. 

2) Elimination - A lot of people know this as 80/20 or the pareto principle. At the beginning of 2019, I read “The One Thing” and I could probably attribute about 90% of my youtube success to this book. Essentially, it says that if you focus your time almost exclusively on the single most important thing, the thing that gives you the greatest return for the least amount of time invested, you will find success.

3) Hyper Prioritization - The next thing that helps me to stay “balanced” is what I call schedule hyper-prioritization. Every month I plan out exactly what I need to do for the next few weeks. Every week I plan out what I need to do every day, and every day I plan out what I should be working on each hour. This may seem like a lot of time spent planning, but as strange as this seems, it actually saves me a tremendous amount of time. 

4) Economies of Scope - Another part of planning is seeing what parts of your life overlap. Often times I will make a YouTube video about a topic that I needed to learn anyway for work. When I do this I am getting what are called economies of scope. This basically means that the cost (time) of producing two things together are less than producing each thing separately. 

5) Ask for Help - When other a tool or other people can do a portion of your work better at a lower cost than your time, it is worth outsourcing. Honestly, this is something I’ve really struggled with, I like to have control over the process, and it takes time to find systems and people that you trust to work with you. Still, I think this is so worth it. 

6) Make it Leisure - When you ask for help and you start to do more of the work that is fun for you and less of the work that isn’t you might start to find additional enjoyment. Something that has really helped me to do more has been finding ways to make my tasks seem more like leisure. This can be difficult to do, but can be one of the secrets to the balancing act. 

7) Design Your Life - Something that you can do to make your work feel like leisure over the long term is to begin to design your life. You choose roles that allow you the types of freedoms you want, you pick hobbies or side hustles that you find fun and interesting, you chase the things you want to do the most.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

vwvdtXMcNzI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Data engineering is now growing faster than data science. I got to thinking, what does this mean for the data domain as a whole. Is this a good thing? Why is it happening now? 

For the most part, data engineering is upstream from data science. The work that they do building data warehouses and data pipelines allows data analysts, data scientists, and ml engineers to build models and create insights from data. Why is this domain, that should precede data science, growing in popularity AFTER data science did? 

For better or for worse, the world doesn’t always work linearly. Data science became sexy because many of the top technology companies were making gobs of money with it. Non-Tech companies saw the value that data science and machine learning was providing and they soon followed suit. 

Unfortunately for many of these companies following the trend, they didn’t have the data infrastructure to properly leverage data scientists. 

I believe the massive uptick in data engineering’s popularity comes from many less technical companies realizing that they made a massive mistake. They needed to hire people to fix their data before hiring all these data scientists.

In this video, I interview Worthan Kwan, a quant trader at a hedge fund to learn about his day to day, how much money people are really making, what the requirements are to become a quant trader, and much more! I also made a post a few weeks back crowdsourcing questions and I'm pretty proud to say that we got through almost all of them in this video :D

#DataScience #DataScienceProjects

1) Tell a cohesive story and be able to explain why you are working on a project 
2) Put the extra time in to collect your own data 
3) Get creative with feature engineering techniques 
4) Try ensemble methods with your models 
5) Productionize your models 
6) Make your models useful to others 
7) Get others to use your projects

Q9FjwzKFPuM,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"In this video I compare the benefits of pursuing a data science certificate versus a bootcamp or masters degree. These all can be reasonable options depending on your personal situation. Watch this video to see which one may be right for you

Data Science Certificate
- Positives (Inexpensive, low time commitment, can help you build out your portfolio)
- Negatives (Likely wont get you a job, not very academically rigerous)
- Good for someone with a phd looking to get data science on their resume or a beginner who wants to see if data science would be interesting to them

Data Science Bootcamp 
- Positives (Good networking and resume resources, reasonable academic rigor)
- Negatives (Very expensive, hit or miss with education, very time consuming)
- Good for someone who has a good portfolio and needs the networking help, someone with a phd in an unrelated field or masters in a related field, or someone who has extra cash to spend 

Data Science Masters degree 
- Positives (checks the graduate degree box, access to university network and resources, internship opportunities, decent exit opportunities)
- Negatives (Most expensive, very time consuming)
- This is a good option for someone who is already an analyst and wants to move into a data science role or someone who wants to become a data analyst but has no relevant experience.

This video provides an overview of how data scientiests and data analysts frequently use lambda within functions like sorted, map, and filter.  We start this video by going over a simple use case of sorting a dictionary using the sorted() function and lambda.  From there we go over the basics of lambda and finally conclude with covering some examples of using lambda to filter a list and also map a list.

YbTMIxjk4hI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Scientist Dismantles the YouTube Algorithm.,"In this video I walk you through some of the specifics of the YouTube Algorithm. My background as a data scientist can help you better understand this algorithm and increase your chances of having it pick your videos up. 

The algorithm wants you to watch YouTube for as long as possible. It prioritizes videos that have a high click through rate (CTR) and high watch time. When you combine these two metrics you get Expected watch time. This is the variable that the algorithm is trying to optimize for with each recommendation.

Jarvis Johnson Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GYXemlyd_Q
YouTube Algo White Paper: https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf
More on the Algo: https://www.tubefilter.com/2017/02/16/youtube-algorithm-reverse-engineering-part-ii/
Another good Algo Resource: https://ammar-alyousfi.com/2020/youtube-trending-videos-analysis-2019-us

The model uses a two phased deep neural net architecture. The first phase takes millions of videos and filters them to less than 1000 relevant videos. The next phase ranks the smaller group of videos based on more specific metrics that youtube has access to. 

Take aways for growth:
1) Maximize Expected Watch time 
2) Give viewers a reason to watch to the end
3) Make videos similar to others in a specific domain 
4) Optimize videos for the 3rd day
5) Tweak things periodically to capitalize on A/B testing

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

domVw8isGOI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"In this video I talk about all of the considerations that went into where I went to school for my masters. I go into how I chose between a masters in computer science and a masters in data science. I also zero in on which schools specifically I applied to, and how I came to my final decision. 

Masters vs certificate vs bootcamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9FjwzKFPuM&t=113s&ab_channel=KenJee

I get an avalanche of questions about which masters degree you should do to become a data scientist. People ask me if they should do a masters in data science, statistics, computer science, and the list goes on and on. I also get asked which specific one people should choose. Honestly, I’ve only done one technical masters degree myself, so I don’t think I can get really granular with the specific school choices. Maybe, just maybe if I get enough input from my peers we will make a collab video with our best advice on how to choose a masters degree, since we will have a couple different perspectives.

Every person has a unique situation, and there are some really good reasons and really bad reasons to do a degree. I don’t think a masters makes sense for most people. I talk about the benefits and drawbacks of choosing a masters vs a bootcamp vs a certificate in the video linked above. Since I can only speak from my experience, I figure it could help a lot of people if I walked through some of the considerations I made when pursuing my own masters degree. For the record I have masters in global commerce and one in computer science, but I think the commerce degree is out of the scope of this video, so I won’t really touch on it here.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

This video provides and overview of how loops (for and while) are used by data scientist and data analysts.  In this tutorial we take time to cover for and while loops and how they are used with different built in functions such as: range(), enumerate(), & .items().  Additionally, we cover loop control statements: break, continue, pass.  Finally, we combine what we learned to analyze the script from the popular TV show ""The Office"" to find lines that contain: That's what she said.

2) The nature of data science work - Will you like the job?
3) Benefits and pay - Will you be compensated fairly?
4) Exit opportunities - What will the career lead to if you want to move on?
5) Secret Sauce (watch to find out)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

The resume is the key to getting that interview, which is definitely the hardest part of the entire application process for a data scientist. Our role is super popular but actual positions few and far between. That's why I spent A LOT of time on this resume to get my foot in the door. We're going to go through this line by line and item by item as I go into the details and roast it hard. Sit back and enjoy! :)

ZWdyBbgGZBQ,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Sports Analytics 101: The Pythagorean Theorem of Sports,"In this video, I walk you through how the Pythagorean Theorem of sports (Baseball) works, and why it is such an important part of sports analytics. 
#DataScience #SportsAnalytics #PythagoreanTheorem
Books:
Mathletics: https://amzn.to/34k8vfv
Trading Bases: https://amzn.to/349S6tD
The Pythagorean theorem of baseball is a function of runs scored and runs scored against. With these two inputs we can very accurately approximate the win % of a baseball season. 

The equation for this is (runs scored)^2 / ((runs scored)^2 + (runs against)^2)

If we can reliably project the expected runs scored and runs scored against for the next season, we can reliably extrapolate that to how many games they are expected to win. 

Wit this we can also evaluate how much of a positive or negative impact a new player will have on a team. We can predict the number of runs that a new player will create. With this formula, we are able to predict the number of wins that this accounts for. This is extremely important for teams when they are evaluating trades and valuing players. They can determine how much a player is worth based on the wins that they contribute. 

This equation can be related to other sports as well, although it is slightly less accurate. Because the number of points scored in football and basketball is higher than baseball, we have to adjust the exponent that we use in the equation

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kjeeone/how-far-should-a-nba-4-point-line-be
GitHub: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/4PointLine
#DataScience #SportsAnalytics #DataScienceProjects #Basketball
I really enjoyed making my video about where the NBA 3-point line should be. I expanded on this analysis to determine where the NBA should put a 4-point line if they were to create one. 

I recommend watching the NBA  3 point line video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BEtGaz70rQ) before watching this one. 

The main idea here is that the NBA 4 point line should be at a place where the points per shot of all 4 pointers are equal to the points per shot of all 3 pointers and all 2 pointers.

To do this analysis we need two things (1) the make probability by distance and (2) the distribution of 4-point shots 

To estimate make probability by distance, I used a logistic regression. This gave us a reasonably accurate, normalized, view of the world here.

To estimate the proportion of shots taken behind the 4-point line, I used the same distribution as three pointers. We are not using the same raw shots, just the percentage of 3's, now 4's that are taken from each incremental distance behind the arc. 

I found that the new 4-point line would be at 26' which is only incrementally further back than my proposed 3-point line.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

sq5TnVJWv6A,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Where YOU Should Start With Data Science Projects,"In this video I walk you through what types of data science projects can be the most useful for your resume.

I also highlight the important elements of any data science project that you are working on in your free time.

Do projects on the three algorithms that data scientists use every day: Classification, Regression, Clustering. Bonus points for using a random forest or a neural net for classification or regression problems. 

#DataScience #DataScienceProjects

A project should be structured:
- Choose a data set (be able to explain why)
- Clean data 
- Explore your data and visualize it 
- Explain the problem you are trying to solve
- Try different algorithms 
- Train / Test and parameter tuning 
- Describe the business impact

GmW4F6MHqqs,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),"This is part two of the new Data Science Project from Scratch Series. In this video I go through how to setup a github repo and collect data for your own data science project. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj
How to set up data science environment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4OPn58BLaU
Chrome Driver Link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Data collection can be a tedious and frustrating process, but you don't necessarily have to start from scratch. You should search github to see if someone has already built a web scraper for the website you are looking at. You should also check to see if the website has an open API. 

For this project, I found someone who had written a glassdoor web scraper and I was able to version it for our purposes. The code and the article that I used are linked here:
Code: https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium
Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905

This web scraper was written in python with the selinium package. 

This is an iterative process, so in this video you will see how I go about debugging my code and making it work. 

Stay tuned for part 3 where I go through and clean up the data that we collected to make it usable for our EDA and model building. 

After we scrape the data, I save the code to github.

MpF9HENQjDo,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 1 (Project Planning),"This is part 1 of my new series, Data Science Project from Scratch. In this video I go through the planning and idea creation for this new data science project. 

I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. 

The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. 

For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches.

I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. 

In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

Kd nuggets link: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/why-data-scientists-leaving-jobs.html

Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1

The problem with data science is that many data scientists don't feel fulfilled by their work. This originates from two ares 1) companies hire data scientists without fully understanding their capabilities 2) data science careers still aren't well defined.

For data scientists: To avoid these pitfalls ask relevant questions in interviews, learn the team and the politics around it. Make sure to understand the other roles that fill out the team as well.

For companies: Make sure that leaders understand what data science is and what it is not. Also more narrowly define data science positions (Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, etc.). Seek the input from data scientists and give them feedback.

2OnXytYziF0,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,What is Sports Analytics Really?,"In this video, I talk about the different types of work that a sports analytics professional may do. Moneyball shaped what is traditionally thought of as sports analytics; however, there are many other types of sports analytics aside from helping teams win.

Type 1: Moneyball - In this role your main goal is to help teams win. You will either help coaches make decisions, players improve performance, or work with your organization to optimize draft picks and trades.

Type 2: DFS & Sports gambling - These careers are primarily focused on predicting the outcome of games. You can work for a sports book, a company recommending picks, or in a portfolio gambling with your own money.

Type 3: Media - Your focus here will be on story telling. Sports analytics in the media try to make the games more interesting by complementing play with statistics.

Type 4: Industry - Companies use sports data to create products for sports teams and fans. You can work for one of these companies to either help coaches or help fans enjoy the game.

My podcast for those  interested: @KNNPodcast 
Podcast Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/KNNClips

Why I think everyone should start a podccast:
1) The single best way to improve your communication skills
2) Allows you to connect with people in a meaningful way that is generally lost in the age of social media.
3) A great way to make lasting friendships
4) Podcasting is an incredible portal towards professional growth
5) Forces you to introspect and challenge your own view points constantly

This should help you to better understand how you can improve your resume as a student. 

Data Science Portfolio
- As a student, try to get to 5-6 projects before you graduate
- Shoot for consistent uploads in github 

Data Science Projects
- Include a table of contents if your readme is long 
- Include insights about your findings in the readme 
- Make the experience of the recruiter as easy as possible (1 page)
- Try not to use pie charts 
- Explain why you use certain models or drop / impute data 

Resume 
- Avoid noisy background styling 
- Show rather than tell (include details on specific new skills learned)
- Include github and kaggle if you have them
- Make sure that you use Action verb + Quantitative outcome + Methods to describe work

a3VWq9smqhM,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"In this video I talk about how to ultralearn data science. This learning philosophy is based off of Scott Young's book ultralearning (linked below). Scott used this approach to learn the entire undergrad MIT Computer Science curriculum in a single year (and pass all the exams). Ultralearning has 9 principles and I show you how you can apply many of them to data science. 

Ultralearning Book: https://amzn.to/33LTvYf
*This is an amazon affiliate link. The couple cents I get from your purchase go to paying off my student loans, so buying is greatly appreciated! This is at no cost to you! 

Principle 1: Metalearning - Plan your learning journey. Think about your data science goal and create a roadmap to get here. This should take up to 10% of your total learning time. If you want to become a data scientist, you need to learn programming and math. Figure out exactly what concepts you need to know from each disciplines.
For learning Coding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN12ZPFsApM
For learning Math: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSwM5uVeylU

Principle 2: Focus - To stick to your data science learning plan, you should train yourself to focus. This is a learned skill. You should pay careful attention to your environment and schedule your time wisely. 
Video on data science focus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akbU9KOo_Qc

Principle 3: Directness - This is my favorite one. If you want to learn data science, you should do data science. You will quickly find out where you are weakest. You should then work on these things. 

Video on projects for your portfolio:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yukdXV9LR48
Where to start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5TnVJWv6A
Beginner Projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8igH8qZafpo
Project Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-R4oUZaC8

Principle 4: Like
Principle 5: Subscribe

Principle 6: Feedback - to maximize your data science performance, you need to focus on feedback loops. Programming is great because you have immediate feedback from error messages. I also recommend reaching out to your friends who are data scientists or people in your network to get feedback on your projects. I also am happy to give resume or project feedback, but please watch all my relevant videos first. 

Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ARnFpk83JauioZb5zyxNZek

Principle 9: Exploration - You need to keep learning because data science is constantly changing.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

AqPquogHwq0,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"In this video I talk about where exactly to start your data science learning journey. This is one of the most frequent questions that I get. Hopefully this will shed some light on your path and give you a concrete starting point.

Unfortunately, everyone learns data science a little differently. What works for me may not work for you.

It matters less where you start learning and more when. You should start right now and choose a course, certificate or project. Just do it. Most of the resources out there are very good, and you won't notice a difference as you learn more.

Once thing people don't realize is that learning data science is additive. If you want to take multiple courses, go ahead! No one learns data science from a single source. I have learned data science concepts from my schoolwork, projects, certificates, other people, etc. You shouldn't think one certificate will teach you everything. 

Again, these are my best tips on where to start learning data science!

Always be curious and love the struggle!

Again, special thanks to Daniel for allowing me to review his project.

Data Science Project Feedback tips:
- Create a thorough readme 
- Make sure to look at averages and central tendency of your data 
-  Do projects that target the companies you are interested in working for

W6N8n99htvw,UCLLw7jmFsvfIVaUFsLs8mlQ,Luke Barousse,Windows on the M1 Mac - What are your options?,"Parallels 14-day Free Trial 👉🏼 https://lukeb.co/ParallelsFreeTrial

VIDEO UPDATE: Parallels is now fully developed for the M1 Mac (i.e. Free Tech Preview is no longer available).  In the US it's $80 USD for this application.  

The switch from Intel (x86 architecture) to M1 Chips (ARM architecture) has made it more difficult to access Windows via your M1 Mac.  In this I go over 4 popular options to access Windows on your machine: Dual Boot (with Boot Camp Assistant), Virtual Machines (with Parallels), Windows Compatibility Layer (with Crossover), and Desktop as a Service (with Amazon Workspaces)

Incase you noticed the turbines moving during the Plane Pull section of the video, we just wanted to mention these engines were on idle therefore not sucking in any air. In order to control the planes braking system you have to have the engines on idle, which is standard in every strong man competition. We also had 2 pilots in the plane with full control of the aircraft along with personnel in contact and guiding them to ensure everything was safe for the kids, parents and crew we had on set that day.

uXLnbdHMf8w,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"In this video I talk about why I am starting data science over again. I go through my reasons for doing this and how you can get involved with this exercise yourself. I include all of the resources and steps that I plan to take on this journey at the end. You can keep track of my progress and share your own using the #66DaysOfData Hashtag! 

Discord Server: https://discord.gg/VXSUJYJ

 Why I'm starting over:
1) I was feeling stale, I didn't feel like I was learning new data science concepts and that my fundamentals were slipping 
2) I felt out of touch with my youtube audience. It had been some time since I reviewed the basics, and I hope this imitative helps me to become a better data science communicator 
3) I wanted to create a clearer roadmap for learning this field.

How you can get involved:
You can get involved by tweeting what data science concepts you are working on learning each day using the #66DaysOfData hashtag. The requirements are low, I just ask that you learn data science for 5 minutes a day and share your progress. This can be through a data science youtube video, data science course, data science project, etc.

BZFfNwj7JhE,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Different Data Science Roles Explained (by a Data Scientist),"#DataScience #KenJee #DataScienceRoles

In this video I explain the different data science roles that exist under the broader data science umbrella. 

Visuals By The Data Professor. Check out his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q

Before explaining these, it is important to understand the data science life cycle. 
1) Data Collection
2) Data Cleaning
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4) Model Building
5) Model Deployment

The difference in the positions is largely based on which part of the data science life cycle that they cover 

Data Scientist - Generally covers the whole lifecycle. Needs the broadest array of skills.
Data Engineer - Mainly covers the data collection and cleaning phases 
Data Analyst - Mainly covers the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis phases (can be flexible towards collection or model building)
Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) - Usually focuses on model building and model deployment.

In this video I talk about the 5 data science new years resolutions that I have made for 2020. I usually don't like to make resolutions, but I think that this is a good way to hold myself accountable going forward. 

1) Write more understandable code - Comment and use functions / objects more frequently 
2) Go to more data science focused events in my area
3) Update the README in my github projects
4) Do more kaggle competitions 
5) Make projects accessible via api endpoint or web application.

He is interested primarily in the financial sector and his projects are reflective of that. Special thanks to him for sending in his work. I think this video will be useful to you if you're interested in a specific domain! 

Resume 
- Great structure 
- Good use of school involvement to supplement work experience 
- Could have more finance related course work or technical skills 
- Should order things in chronological order 

Github 
- Great use of coding projects that provide real value
- Great documentation and examples in the readme of coding projects
- Could stand to improve the readme's of the actual ML focused projects.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Ip50cXvpWY4,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,The Best Free Data Science Courses Nobody is Talking About,"In this video, I talk about the best free data science courses that I would recommend online. I find that for some reason, these courses aren't getting the publicity and recognition that they perhaps deserve. 

Course 1: Kaggle Data Science Micro Courses - These courses are through the kaggle platform and introduce you to the basics of python, machine learning and deep learning. I like this course because it can help you to get started on data science projects as quickly as possible.  
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview

Course 2: The Google Machine Learning Crash Course - This course is through google and can be used with the google colab python environment. This course has a video component that is quite informative. 
Link: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course
Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true
Course 3: Fast.ai. This course is one of the best for learning deep learning concepts.

8Vxjp2KVHqs,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"In this video I review Pranay's resume, data science portfolio website, and his github profile. This is definitely one of the cleanest portfolio websites I have seen! 

Resume 
- Does a great job including an extensive list of technical skills, should include numpy and pandas though
- Be sure to include more details about the value you are providing in your work and projects 
- Picture is ok in this case because he is interviewing mostly in Germany 

Data science portfolio website
- Love the one page design 
- very easy to read through 
- put research at the top as it is the most recent position 
- put certificates at the end as I think they hold the least weight

6fwyyRgZlD0,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 9 (Professional Violinist),"In this video I review Keshav's data science resume and portfolio. Keshav has some awesome experience with software engineering, and with a few resume tweaks, he can likely increase his job opportunities going forward. 

Resume
- Technical skills should be up top 
- Certificates can go under education 
- Awesome experience as a professional violinist (should definitely include unique things like this)
- No need for a summary statement 

Github 
- Well thought out Readme files with great pictures
- Should include more projects with relevant analysis that you are interested in

In it, I give examples of how sports analytics has changed the way games are played, talk about my experience getting into the field, and give a concrete example of a project that I worked on.

My work mostly focuses on golf and basketball analytics. We build models to help improve the performance of the athletes and teams that we work with.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

QQLToUlgN7A,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"In this video, I give you my thoughts on the best computer for data science beginners. I talk about the hardware components of a computer and how those relate to your data science performance. At the end, I give my thoughts on the best computer for you to purchase. 

The cpu is in charge of the processing power of the computer. It mostly controls how fast processing for normal data science operations is. 

The ram stands for random access memory. It determines how much data can be processed in a single batch.

You will also need a hard drive. I recommend stead state memory. This doesn't have much impact on performance of your models, so you don't need to go crazy here. This is the cheapest type of memory though so you can scale up at a low cost. 

The last main component that is relevant for data science is the GPU. NVIDIA recently sent me a Titan RTX, and I am excited to be experimenting with that in future videos. For deep learning, you should really have at least 6 gb of gpu memory. If you are playing graphics intensive games or editing videos, I recommend increasing this further. 

My final recommendation: Your computer really doesn't matter much. Data science is done mostly on the cloud making your computer relatively irrelevant. You have access to top of the line GPU's and even TPU's on kaggle.com or through google colab. In my opinion, the best computer for data science is the one that you can afford. 

If you still want to do something locally, I recommend the following requirements 

CPU (4 cores): Ryzen 5, 7, 9 should suffice
Ram: Minimum 8gb but 16 is preferred 
HD: 256gb
GPU: NVIDIA with 6+ GB of memory (4 + gb if if laptop)

My laptop: https://amzn.to/2W3Zh4E

Budget PC Parts  
CPU: Ryzen 5 ($150) https://amzn.to/38MaLPp
RAM: Corsair 16gb ($75) https://amzn.to/38FfiTV
HD: WD SSD 480 GB ($55) https://amzn.to/3fgdUcR
GPU: GTX 1660 ($230)  https://amzn.to/3iNaUqx
Total: $510 (before case, motherboard & power supply ~$200) 

Mid Tier PC Parts 
CPU: Ryzen 7 ($284) https://amzn.to/2Ci9IuC
RAM: Corsair 32gb ($150) https://amzn.to/38FfiTV
HD: WD SSD 480 GB ($55) https://amzn.to/3fgdUcR
GPU: RTX 2070 ($640) https://amzn.to/3iLwiwg
Total: $1129 (before case, motherboard & power supply ~$200) 

High Tier PC Parts 
CPU: Ryzen 9 ($423) https://amzn.to/2BN2bUN
RAM: Corsair 32gb ($150) https://amzn.to/38FfiTV
HD: SAMSUNG SSD 1 TB ($179) https://amzn.to/3egXakr
GPU: Titan RTX  ($2500) https://amzn.to/2ZbELBc (borderline overkill)
Total: $3252 (before case, motherboard & power supply ~$200)

Most data scientists use Anaconda, which is a data science specific platform. Through anaconda you have access to the spyder ide, jupyter notebooks and R studio. 

In this video, I also show you how to set up an environment to switch between different versions of python.

sHRq-LshG3U,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"In this video I highlight the main reasons why it is unlikely that you will become a data scientist. TO BE CLEAR I still think it is possible for anyone to break into this field, but I also think it is important to set realistic expectations. 

Subscribe to the Newsletter here! https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter

1) Educational Burden - Data science is a multidisciplinary field. You need to learn computer science, coding, and subject area knowledge. You really need to invest many hours into this endeavor. 
- Project Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AReJn7nZfqOKLZ3IpKj7fwc
- Kaggle Courses (Free): https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview
- 365 Data Science (57% Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY

2) Market Saturation - There is a huge supply of entry level data scientists. With more people, that means the probability of landing a data science job is lower. 

3) Data Science isn't a good fit for you - It takes a lot of time and dedication to break into this field. It helps to be very passionate about the work. There are other great careers like software engineering that have a lower barrier to entry where you make similar income (if not more).

4) Ambiguity - Data science job postings are very unclear / unreliable.

5) Continued learning - You need to be adaptable in your role. It takes habits or huge motivation to keep studying. 

Congratulations! If you made it this far you likely have one of the most important skills for breaking into this field. 

That skill is GRIT.

7LDKpNLsBpc,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,Data Science vs Software Engineering Interview | 3 Key Differences,"Hi frends! In this video, I go through the 3 key differences between the data science vs software engineering interview. I also give y'all my best tips on how to ace them both. I think this is super helpful if you're applying for both at the same time - just like I did. I previously also made a video on the 5 key differences of software engineering vs data science and how I chose between the two. So if you haven't already, I highly recommend checking that out too. Enjoy! :)

KHAuuOQui2U,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"In this video I talk through what you need to know before starting a data science internship. I also give you some tips on how to prepare for these internships as a whole. 

First, I recommend just applying. A bias towards action helps you to figure out the areas that you need to work on. 

I also think you should have at least a foundation in programming either using python or R. You also should have taken at least an intro to stats course.

If you want to put your best foot forward, you should be familiar with the 3 main types of data science algorithms: Regression, Classification, and Clustering. 

I also recommend that you do some projects to solidify these skills. These are some beginner projects that I recommend doing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8igH8qZafpo

Finally, it isn't the end of the world to not get a data science or machine learning internship. You have plenty of options that can still look good on your resume.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

About me 


Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

In order to deal with these discouraging feelings, we need to first get more specific with what we are feeling. More broadly, I find that these feelings come in a couple different varieties. (Confusion, anxiety, stress, and frustration), overwhelm/ Hopelessness, and inadequacy. 

The first group of feelings are usually temporary. The arise when we are struggling with a specific problem. I find that these manifest themselves in physical symptoms for myself. I get headaches, I get antsy, I feel tired. To combat these, I have found that a physical change is the most effective remedy. 

For overwhelm and hopelessness in data science, these feelings don't go away easily. Usually you feel helpless after you get overwhelmed by how big the field is. First, no one is expected to have an understanding over the complete domain of data science. There are a couple things you can do here. First, focus on projects. These are a great way to narrow the scope of learning. Second, build or subscribe to a structured course of study. 365 Data Science (the sponsor of this video), provides a great curriculum for this.

Finally, the feeling of inadequacy is the largest contributor to discouragement (Impostor Syndrome). I first recommend starting to cultivate a growth mindset. Second, track your progress, remind yourself how far you've come. Finally, use real data to evaluate yourself.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

Maybe you heard of data science and you wanted to learn more. Maybe you work with a data scientist and want to better understand their role, or you even have the goal of becoming one. This video was made for you. 

Data science is actually quite a bit older than many of us realize. It was first mentioned with computer science and then with statistics. 

Data science is an aptly named field. Data science is a domain where we work with data to generate some form of value. And we use scientific techniques to extract this value.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

iGUiLWFDWfk,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Don't Buy My Course..,"In this video I talk about my new course How to Start a Career in Data Science. While I think it is a good product, I don't think that this is for everyone. In the video, I talk about why someone like myself would create a course, who courses may be a good fit for, and who may or may not benefit from my specific offering. 

Places to gain access to my course, if you think it would be a good fit for you.

0:00 Intro
1:08 Why would someone like me make a course?
3:12 What should you consider before buying an online course?
6:07 Why you should NOT buy my course
6:54 Why you SHOULD buy my course

Why I created this course:
1) Since I don't do youtube full time, I needed help to produce something that I thought would have the most impact. Partnering with 365 data science gave me access to the video, editing, and administrative resources to make a product that I am proud of. 
2) The financial stability of a course is really nice. I would like to continue to produce as much youtube content as possible going forward. Having some financial cushion allows me more freedom to produce here. One day, I hope to have the option to do youtube full time, this was a major step towards achieving this goal. 

What to consider before purchasing a course:

What value do courses provide? They consolidate information and make it easily teachable. Most information from these courses is available for free online already. However, usually it is very disorganized and will take tremendous effort to learn. Courses trim through the noise. You should find a course that matches your learning style. The instructor is also important. If you're going to be investing hours of your time, make sure you can put up with the person talking to you. 

Set clear expectations about courses. Data science courses will not get you a job or make you into a data scientist. You will need to do most of the work! 

Don't buy my course if:
1) You can't afford it
2) You don't like to hear me talk 
3) If you're learning data science for fun and aren't interested in pursuing it as a career 

My course may be a good fit for you if:
1) You have most of the data science skills and you are looking to land your first job or change into a new data science role 
2) You are willing to put in the hard work required to prepare 
3) You REALLY like hearing me talk

In all seriousness, I made this course with the main intention of helping people to break into this field that I love. I had a blast producing it and am really proud of the product. I also couldn’t be happier with the support that 365 data science provided me. It wouldn’t have been possible without them.

I wanted to determine what the general feeling about the movie was on twitter. Here I use sentiment analysis to determine what people thought of the movie leading up to it and after the premier. I also compare the sentiment of Captain Marvel to Avengers: Infinity war, the previous summer's blockbuster.

I get some very interesting results!

LGEuDWjWQes,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Applying Data Science To My YouTube Data: My Surprising Findings,"In this video I analyze my YouTube data using Data Science Techniques. YouTube does a great job of presenting useful descriptive statistics to it's users; however I wanted to dig a little deeper into my viewership numbers. I wanted to determine if it was possible to increase the growth of my channel with the insights gleaned from my analysis. 

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/YouTube_Data

First I visualize the data using matplotlib. I show the last year of my views, watch time, subscribers, likes, and few other metrics. Next, I normalize these charts by looking at a 7 day rolling average. 

It is clear from the charts that I have experienced steady growth over the last year. There are some spikes that I have attributed to social media posts that I have made. 

Next I wanted to determine if there was a best day for me to post videos. After normalizing the data to remove days with videos and social media posts, it appears that Monday's have a slight uptick in viewership. 

After this, I wanted to determine actually how much each feature impacts my watch time and subscriber count. I ran two multiple linear regressions, one with watch time as the dependent variable and one where subscriber count was the dependent variable. 

The features that I chose to try to predict watch time accounted for ~82% of the variance in my videos. I found that a new post generally attributed to a ~50 minutes of increased view time. A Intro post generally attributed to twice as much ~110 minutes of view time, and a video posted equated to about ~185 minutes of increased view time. The only day of the week that had a significant p-value was Thursday, and on those days I received ~22 min less viewership. 

For subscribers these factors only explained ~35% of the variance. Interestingly enough, the only significant factors were watch time of the previous day, If I did a facebook intro post, and the day after I published a video. If I did a facebook intro post my model suggests that I will gain ~17 followers the next day. The day after I post a video I can also expect an additional 3 subscribers.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

In it I walk through the most important data cleaning techniques using pandas. Data cleaning is extremely important process in data science. There is an old adage in data science ""garbage in garbage out"", if we don't provide clean data to our models, we will get poor results. Data cleaning is essential in becoming a great data scientist. This video will show you how to clean data by removing and/or imputing null values, cleaning and standardizing data types, and using graphs to understand anomalies in your data.

🛑 NOTE: Under multi-threading testing conditions the M1 Max is of course faster than the M1.  BUT as a data analyst, I more frequently run single-threaded code; therefore, the benefits of paying +$1K for these minimum gains are not worth the money.  I've also tested many other multi-threaded applications for data analysts and don't notice much of a performance increase.  Because of this, I recommend the M1 Macbook Air for those starting in data science. 

🌟 OTHER NOTE: I'm not actually selling my M1 Max... sorry. 🤣.  This is a great computer if you are working with tools outside of the data science realm (like video editing in my case).

🐍 Technical details of test 👉🏼 A 100,000 iterating loop test requiring list comprehension for paragraphs processed with NLP.  Test was performed multiple times on these computers to verify results.

oMdVg6GPODA,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,"In this video I talk about the 3 reasons why right now it is a great time to learn data science. 

Right now the world is going through a period of change. It has been disrupted by illness, and will likely not return to how it was before. While it is a scary time, this can also be a great opportunity to reflect and to improve yourself. 

Reason 1: You likely have more time than ever to learn data science. With social distancing your leisure time is changing. Most people likely will have to spend more time inside and you might as well use that time to learn data science or programming. 

Reason 2: The culture of work will begin to shift. Generally, work from home will become more accepted in the workplace. If you have technical skills programming, data science, etc. you will be well equipped to deal with the new job market. 

Reason 3: People are relying heavily on quantitative information.

Vijay Pravin Maharajan has had quite the impressive career in data science and as a speaker. He was named on the top 40 Data Scientists under 40 in India, and he was the first Indian to be invited to give a ted x talk in Germany below the age of 30.

Vijay came from a electrical engineering background and currently works for the German Branch of Siemens as a data analytics expert. If you’re interested in learning more about him after watching this interview, you can find some additional details on his linkedin (where he boasts over 33k followers). 

In this interview we focus on how to transition into data science from less traditional majors like EE, how to break into data science roles in other countries (a much requested topic), and how to get comfortable with public speaking.

I talk about what git is, why it's important, and I also go through the general workflow of a data science project using git. 

At the most basic level, git is a version control system. It also allows us to work on things simultaneously with our teammates without messing anything up. To be honest, it has revolutionized project management and process control. 

Git lets us track our changes and revert back to previous versions as well.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

I have recently gotten into daily fantasy basketball. Many experts suggest that minutes played is highly correlated with daily fantasy points. The basic equation is Projected Minutes Played * Avg FTPS per minute. 

I compare the predictive power of various rolling averages, a linear regression, and a random forest model. These are all implemented in python 3.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

I know what it's like to start out and not know what skills to learn first. You don't know how long it should take you and you aren't sure in what order you need to learn them. In this video we discuss the top skills you need to know as well as in what order. We then go into why you need to learn them and the things you should focus on within each skill.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Sales are part of almost all jobs now, but not in the traditional sense. Data Scientists are selling ideas, methodologies, and concepts not necessarily products. 
#DataScience
Medium Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/sell-me-this-classifier-ce80f13d7e7e

Books 
To Sell is Human by Daniel Pink: https://amzn.to/2JN5LyU
The Science of Selling by David Hoffeld: https://amzn.to/36xB8Hl
Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff: https://amzn.to/2JNv8Ap

Where do you use sales skills as a data scientist?
(1) In the interview you have to sell your personality, your skill-set and your background 
(2) On the job you have to sell your projects, your methodology, and your work 
(3) In manager positions, you have to sell the concept of data science to the organization, you also have to sell your team's projects to get company resources 

How to level up your selling skills for data science:
(1) Have others articulate the value that you and your work provide
(2) Use mirroring to get on the same page 
(3) Get small commitments and confirmations
(4) Demonstrate your past and future value
(5) Elicit an emotional response through story telling

Scraping Data from Donald Trump's Twitter and creating visualizations with it has never been easier! I did this project a while back just to see what the results would be and I ended up thinking it was pretty cool. This is not a project that is in my current portfolio, but it could easily be altered to be a great starter project!

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Data science is a hot topic in tech, seeing as I am a practicing data scientist, I figured I would explain what the field encompasses. I also thought I would spice it up with a little heat. 

Don't try this at home, I immediately regretted eating the pepper. 

Bottom line, in this video I answer the question: What is data science?

QWgg4w1SpJ8,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"This is part 4 of the Data Science Project from Scratch Series. In this video I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data that we collected from glassdoor in part 2 and cleaned in part 3. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

EDA is where we really start understanding our data. It where we start analyzing trends and begin to find insights. 

First, I do some additional data cleaning. I clean up the job titles, and do some feature engineering. 

Next, I look at histograms and box plots of the continuous data fields. This is an important step because we want normal data if we plan to do a regression analysis. 

We then look at the categorical data. We want to see what companies, states, industries, and sectors these jobs are offered in. 

After that, we make some pivot tables to better understand how average salary is different across our categorical categories. 

Finally, we make a word cloud to visualize some of the most common words found in the descriptions. 

Please stay tuned for part 5 where we start building models to predict salary!

Hopefully this video helps you to increase your productivity and enjoyment as you work in this new world.

3) Put your phone in another room 
4) Spend some time doing nothing 
5) Set firm stop and start times to your work day to prevent your job from bleeding into your personal life.

1️⃣ ChatGPT + Coursera: You can now learn new skills right inside ChatGPT. Just ask “Coursera, teach me data analytics,” and it’ll show short expert videos, quick quizzes, and even full course options all without leaving chat.

2️⃣ NotebookLM: Still my favorite for studying and research. It helps me take huge chunks of papers, transcripts, notes and turn them into something clear and easy to understand. (The podcast mode is so good for reviewing!)

3️⃣ Perplexity: My go-to for digging deeper when I’m learning something new. It gives clear answers with sources and helps me explore topics without getting lost in ten open tabs.

All three are free to start using and they’ve quietly become part of my daily learning routine. 💜",2025-10-29T15:55:20Z,[],21723,453,22,PT7S,hd,false,public,True,False

Building habits is hard and it's taken me years and years but they are so worth it. As James Clear says: ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

jf3j0lWmFPU,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"In this video, I talk about the 5 pillars of success that have changed my life for the better. While I still have a long way to go myself, I would hope that these concepts can help you to reprogram yourself for a happier and more productive life. 

1) Habits 
- Motivation is fickle
- Habits allow you to skip the need for motivation
- Habits help you do difficult tasks mindlessly
- Are how you create lasting change 
Atomic Habits: https://amzn.to/2GQSoPz
Tiny Habits: https://amzn.to/2ZrYhca
The Power of Habit: https://amzn.to/2ZpUwUE

2) Identity
- Changing who we are is not as hard as we think
- We act in line with who we believe ourselves to be
- We have to tell ourselves what type of person we are
- A growth mindset is the difference maker 
- We program ourselves every time we open our mouths 
Psychocybernetics: https://amzn.to/3bN6PPQ

3) Accountability 
- What we say to our peers has a huge impact on what we do
- We must believe we are someone that sticks to our word 
- Social pressure can have a positive impact on us 

 4 Disciplines of Execution: https://amzn.to/3hkLMWb
Tiny Habits: https://amzn.to/2ZrYhca
Awaken the Giant Within: https://amzn.to/2ZucR31

4) Feedback 
- We can't improve if we don't know what to work on 
- You get discouraged if you don't see improvement 
- Tracking our performance and getting feedback allows us to see how far we've come
- We should celebrate our successes 
4 Disciplines of Execution: https://amzn.to/3hkLMWb

5) Focus 
- We chase too many rabbits
- If we narrow our focus to only the important things we can accomplish great things 

The One Thing: https://amzn.to/2ZoRQGP

All of these concepts can be applied to the #66DaysOfData Initiative. If you are learning data science or any other field, I would hope that these things can help you to maximize your performance and enjoyment!

The Titanic Project Walk-through - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3FBJdiExcg&ab_channel=KenJee

Project 1: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - This shows that you can clearly tell a story with your data. It also shows that you can collect, clean, and perform feature engineering. I recommend scraping your data or collecting it from an open api.

Project 2: Classification problem - With these projects you are predicting a binary or categorical outcome. An example would be the titanic dataset where you predict if people would have survived the crash. 

Project 3: A regression problem - In these types of analyses, you try to predict a continuous outcome. An example would be predicting how many likes a youtube video would get ;).

Project 4: A clustering problem - With this we use algorithms to understand which data points are related to eachother. 

Project 5: An advanced topic (NLP, Computer Vision, Deep Neural Nets) - These projects allow you to specialize and show off your skills!

(NOTES: Course price is $49 USD per month.  25% discount ended 12-May-2021.)

In this video, we go through how I used my fitness watch's GPS data to calculate how many jumps I am hitting every day on my mountain bike.  I use the Strava app to track all of my fitness data from my watch.  Because of this, I can access Strava's API with Python to pull my fitness data on where I have gone for the day.  From there I use Python to combine the number of jumps that are on each trail with my Strava data to then visualize the number of jumps I hit.

1aXk2RViq3c,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How to Make A Data Science Portfolio Website with Github Pages,"In this video I show you how to quickly build a data science portfolio website using github pages. It can be extremely valuable to have a data science portfolio, it shows potential employers a condensed version of your project work.

Most recruiters don't have time or the ability to sift through your whole github repo. A website shows that you can convey information effectively and that you are straight to the point. 

Github Repo: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/Ken_Portfolio
Github Pages Details: https://pages.github.com/
Written tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/9-minutes-to-a-data-science-portfolio-website-80b79ced6c54
Advanced Portfolio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8

Steps for setting up the website:
1) Create a github account
2) Make a new github repo and initialize the readme
3) Go to settings 
4) Go to GitHub pages and select master branch
5) Select theme if you would like
6) Go to the link at the top of the github pages secion 
7) make any changes you would like to the markdown of the readme to get your content

You now have a data science portfolio website!

yUrrf3Pm33s,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"In this video I will highlight the 3 techniques that I use to discover projects to work on. 

Many people I talk to struggle to come up with data science projects. To me, identifying problems and digging into them is one of the most important parts of becoming a data scientist to begin with. Finding interesting projects is a skill and is something you can improve on. 

Technique 1 - Focus on the problems that you face. Data science can be used to help solve these and make your life or the lives of people around you easier. I recommend writing 10 project ideas each day to get you used to coming up with them.

Technique 2 - Browse datasets and find one you like. There are tons of repositories of free data online, kaggle, google datasets, etc.. You can just browse these and pursue a dataset that piques your interest.

Technique 3 - Get feedback from and analyze your communities. Most online forums are filled with problems. Use data science to help solve them!

UpaEjBOMNqs,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,"In this video I talk about the 5 main strategies that are proven to land you a data science job. There may be a bonus 6th strategy at the end 😉.

1) Resume drop - I believe this to be the least effective of the 5 approaches. From the data collected at sharpest minds, a data science mentoring company, they found that only 1-2 percent of resume drops actually ended up leading to an interview. This is an extremely low percentage, and this means the average person needs to apply to 50-100 jobs to get just one interview. I personally don’t like these odds. 

2) Private job board - An example of this would be using the job platform available from your university as a student or an alum. In most cases, this reduces the amount of applications for each role you apply to. You are no longer competing with the general public, and are now just competing with others from your university. There are also professional organizations or communities that you can be a part of that have private job boards. I would get creative with the job boards you explore and look for startup incubators, vc firms, etc. 

3) Recruiter - You can reach out to data science specific recruiters, but often they will reach out to you if you have a been doing projects and sharing your work. Working with a recruiter increases your odds because they have existing relationships with companies and them vouching for you gives you additional social proof. Recruiters also do a lot of the work for you, they find opportunities on your behalf and can sometimes even help you with your resume / application process. 

4) In-company transfer - Most companies are interested in the happiness of their employees and also saving money. If you move into a data science role within the current organization, they keep you happy, and they also get to avoid the hiring costs associated with finding a new data scientist. Most people are afraid to ask their boss about exploring new tools and trying to pivot positions. You truly never know what is possible if you don’t ask, they may even be willing to pay for your trainings. This step really only works if you’re in a role that is related to data science already, this technique makes sense if you’re in a data analyst, software engineering role, or doing something relatively technical. If you’re not doing anything close to technical, you can first try to pivot into a data analyst role and then keep transitioning slowly. 

5) Referral -Again, the team at sharpestminds have see that using this approach can increases your chances of getting an interview by upwards of 10 times. Having an employee refer you give you instant credibility. Additionally, hr will usually not want to disappoint the existing employee, so they will usually give you the benefit of the doubt. If it wasn’t clear already, having a relationship with the company either through a recruiter, a friend, or a job, is what maximizes your chances. 

(Bonus) Internship - Internships are lower hanging fruits than traditional jobs. Often they are used to see if people would be a good fit for a full time position. I kind of look like an internship as a really long interview with a fairly high chance of success. Do your best in these and you can greatly increase your chances of landing your first full time data science job.

Mistake 3: Focus on algorithms not outcomes
Mistake 4: Descriptions are too vague 
Mistake 5: Telling rather than showing 
Mistake 6: No personality in resume 
Mistake 7: Grammatical errors 
Mistake 8: No projects

_rbrdNTpZGo,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Building a Deep Learning BEAST (NVIDIA TITAN RTX + RYZEN 3900X),"In this video I build a deep learning beast! I have a few projects in the pipeline that will require some additional computing resources, so I have decided to build a new data science workstation. Don't forget to comment below with the name for my new pc! The best one will get a Jetson Nano Developers Kit! 

I built this computer around the graphics card. Special thanks to NVIDIA for sending over a TITAN RTX for me to experiment with. This will be incredible for the deep learning projects I have planned. It will also come in handy for the video editing that I do! 

TITAN RTX: https://amzn.to/30DaL0y
TITAN RTX Details: https://nvda.ws/32ViJVx


For the CPU I went with the RYZEN 9 3900x. I have used AMD chips in the past, and I have had a good experience with them. This chip was a good balance between price and performance for this build.

Jeremie is the co-founder of SharpestMinds, a data science, machine learning and analytics mentorship program that's free until you get a job. SharpestMinds is a Y Combinator backed startup,  the world’s largest mentorship marketplace for data science, with mentors from companies like Google, Tesla, Airbnb and Shopify. He's also the host of the official Towards Data Science podcast, where he talks to world-class data scientists and machine learning researchers about everything from data careers to the future of humanity. I was actually on his podcast a few weeks ago, so definitely go check that out after this (linked below)

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

IFceyuL6GZY,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How I Became A Data Scientist From a Business Background,"In this video I provide recommendations on how to move into a data science role from a non-technical background. This transition takes some serious effort, but is definitely attainable! 

In data science, you need a specific set of skills. From a business or economics background, you generally need to brush up on the coding and technical skills first. 

You should focus on learning python or R first. You will also need to develop an understanding of SQL. There are some great free resources to learn these skills, but my favorite is kaggle. 

Depending on your experience, you may have more success breaking into data science through the visualization and story telling route. Learning Tableau or Power BI can be an incredible asset for data science teams. 

Generally, you can self study using online data science courses, or you can go back to graduate school to get a data science degree.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

15c7WD-lKUY,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"ML Ops was very confusing to me at first. People were telling me it was useful, but would never tell me what it was. In this video I explain what ML Operations is (ML Ops), where it came from, and why learning it could be useful for your career. 

Be sure to check out the @KNNPodcast for some awesome interviews with people like Joe Reis! 
Check out the KNN clips channel for short insights from the show: https://www.youtube.com/c/KNNClips

Ml ops came from Development Operations (devops). Dev ops are essentially anything that facilitates the collaboration between software teams or it operations teams. The goal is to make software repeatable, testable, and scalable. 

So how is ML Ops different?
- Focus on exclusively ML projects
- Different data needs than most software projects
- Different types of testing and experimentation 
- Different tools used to monitor ML models

Best place to learn ML ops is on the job. Still projects, conversations, communities, etc. are great! 

Special thanks to @JoeReisData (Joe Reis) for giving me some extra thoughts here!

Unfortunately, this day was not overwhelmingly exciting. Many people believe data science to be an extremely sexy job; however, most of the time, it is data manipulation and quality analysis. 

Data Science is extremely sedentary, so I mix in exercise to find some balance.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

9-2OKLZfvbE,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Questions You Should Ask Your Data Science Interviewers,"When your interviewer asks if you have any questions for them, do you freeze up? This is a critical part of the interview, and you should come prepared. These are my tips on the questions to ask your interviewer once it is your time.

#DataScience #KenJee #DataScienceInterview

1) Ask about relevant questions or about current events related to the team or the company.
2) What project management philosophy does your team use? How do data scientists work with the software engineering team and the business units? 
3) What development opportunities are there within the company? Opportunities to learn new skills and build leadership skills.
4) Ask your interviewer about their experience with the company and their background.
5) What is the company culture around work, work from home, etc.? 
6) Ask about the hardest or most exciting problems the team is working on right now. 
7) Ask about what problems the team would like to be working on in a few years. 
8) What technologies does your team use and the other teams? 
9) How do you evaluate performance at the company?
10) What part of my background / experience would best qualify me for this role? 
11) Next steps?

Check out the the KNN Podcast here: @KNNPodcast 
Brennan's Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIV3m7XOmE&ab_channel=Ken%27sNearestNeighborsPodcast

To be clear the this isn't to say that the data science role is better than the data analyst role. They are two different positions that require a slightly different set of skills. Many people like my friend @AlexTheAnalyst prefer the data analyst life! 

These are my best tips on transitioning from data analyst to data scientist:
1) Show that you can code - You can do this by building a strong github or kaggle portfolio
2) Highlight your strengths - If you show that you meet the coding requirements, you should celebrate your business understanding or subject area expertise. Companies love to see the value you have driven 
3) Apply data science to your current role - There are likely opportunities for you do do data science in your current work. Find them and experiment 
4) Let your job pay to upskill you - Many companies offer training or a stiped for education. Use these things to learn data science skills
5) Look for new roles inside your current company - There are likely positions available to you within your current org. Focus here first
6) Join communities to learn about new roles - If you need to look outside your current company, communities are the best place to start.

-pdXWmj9xxU,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How I Learn Data Science Through Studying Other People's Code | #66DaysOfData,"In this video I talk about one of my favorite ways of learning data science: Reviewing other people's code. I also include a short example of me going through this process at the end!

I think that code review is one of the most overlooked ways to learn data science. When we are starting out, we don't know the possible feature space for data science solutions. We could spend all day thinking about answers in a jupyter notebook and not get anywhere. When we look at how other people solve data science problems, we start to build intuition. First we copy their process, but eventually we learn the logic behind their decision making. This allows to eventually come up with unique data science solutions on our own. 

I think it is also worth noting that you should diversify your data science learning. Look at multiple notebooks solving the same problem or using the same data science algorithm. You may find that one example makes far more sense to you than another. 

My process for code review is this:
1) Go through and mark all of the things that I don't understand & open up a window with the documentation for the package if available 
2) Go back through and try to understand the code snippet while looking at the code and the documentation together.
3) Implement the solution in my own project.

I talk about some of the different ways to show your coursework and the types of projects that he could do to make his portfolio more robust. 

Again, special thanks to Raisham for letting me review his project portfolio! 

Data science portfolio advice
1) Use a nice high quality photo on your github profile 
2) Make sure that you use the readme to let employers know a high level overview of the projects
3) Highlight your most important resources
4) Organize your work into either individual repos or repos with projects 
5) Try to have at least 4 personal projects for review (Regression, Classification, and Clustering)
6) Use plain text or comments to document your code

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

I3FBJdiExcg,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"In this video I walk through an entire Kaggle data science project. I use the titanic kaggle competition to show you how I start thinking about the problems. I also show you the systematic approach that I use to explore the data, build the models, and submit the solution.

Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/titanic-project-example
My Kaggle Profile: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee

Feel free to follow along with the code! You don't need to understand everything that is going on under the hood of the algorithms, for a beginner, learning to implement them should be enough.

This video covers
- Project Planning 
- Data exploration 
- Data Visualization (light)
- Replacing null values 
- Feature engineering 
- Data Cleaning 
- Model Production
- Model Tuning
- Kaggle model submission

4OZip0cgOho,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"In this video, I talk about how I would learn data science if I had to start again from scratch. Learning data science and machine learning is a little bit different for everyone, but hopefully this video will help you to build the necessary foundation to tackle these fields. 

1) Learn programming in python or R 
 - Advice for college students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjhW1rSQeik 
2) Learn basic statistics for data science 
 - Free courses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4
3) Start projects as soon as you can 
 - Use https://www.kaggle.com/ to review code and work on basic projects 
 - Beginner projects video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8igH8qZafpo
4) Take notes on what algorithms and packages others use 
5) Learn the source code for the algorithms and try to implement them from scratch 
6) Work on more advanced projects where you collect your own data or use advanced concepts like deep learning, nlp, or computer vision.

Data Professor],"In this video, I collaborate with the Data Professor to show you how to build a Portfolio Website using Hugo & Github Pages. This is a more advanced version of the portfolio that I build in a previous video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aXk2RViq3c

Hugo Source Code: https://github.com/dataprofessor/Ken_Portfolio_src
Compiled version: https://github.com/dataprofessor/Ken_Portfolio
Website: https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/

I also recommend checking out the Data Professor's YouTube Channel. He has great tutorials and an awesome virtual internship series: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q

A data science portfolio website can greatly help your career opportunities. It is a clean way to showcase your data science projects, and it also shows that you can clearly communicate your work and findings. 

GitHub Pages allows you to host this through their website, while Hugo allows you to create an awesome web framework using only markdown language.

In this video I talk about the reasons why I quit data science to pursue a role as  business consultant and project owner. I break down my considerations and my experiences. 

I also talk about why I ended up coming back to data science after less than a year in this new role.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

People struggle to learn data science because the field is so big and overwhelming. You have to learn computer science, math, and business concepts. It is easy to get lost along the way.

These are a few tips to get past this roadblock:
1) Start somewhere (it doesn't matter where)
2) Break data science into small chunks
3) Get good at small parts and then tie them together

About me 


Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

He as quite a few deep learning projects in it. I go through the high level portfolio and drill down into a couple specific projects. 

Takeaways 
- Great use of tables and graphs to show value 
- You should make sure to add comments at any decision point in your analysis 
- Readme's should include all relevant info about the data and the nature of the project
- Pin projects or use a landing page to showcase your most relevant projects

Thanks again to Talha for submitting his work!

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

💬 Prompt in ChatGPT for Python in Excel 
=======================
🤓 You are a distinguished data nerd that is an expert in both Python and Excel. 
🐍 Excel recently released a feature allowing the use of Python within it's program. 
💿 I have provided you an Excel spreadsheet familiarize yourself with the contents.
💬 When I provide you a prompt there is no need to ask if I'm ready. Just Do It.
🧑‍💻 I will be asking you questions and if it refers to python code I want you to provide me the results in the following format:
1. The expected results or visualizations
2. The full code snippet needed to insert into Excel
2a. When providing code snippets the last line of code in Python MUST be the output of the cell (whether a variable, or a chart)
2b. This last line does not require the use of the print() statement (a special feature of Python in Excel)
2c. The data has been loaded in the excel spreadsheet under the name 'jobs_df'
2d. The following is already imported in the environment (so don't re-import):
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels as sm
import seaborn as sns
import excel

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

qV_AlRwhI3I,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,What is the #66DaysOfData?,"In this video I tell you everything you need to know about the #66DaysOfData Challenge I will be starting up again on January 4th!

The #66DaysOfData challenge is designed to help you create great data science learning habits. Along with the habits you will be joining an incredible community where you can learn alongside and work with other likeminded people! 

The challenge is simple, it only has two parts.
1) Learn data science every day for 66 days straight. You should learn for a minimum of 5 minutes per day. 
2) Share your progress on your social media platform of choice using #66DaysOfData. 

This has 3 main benefits:
1) You create a habit of daily learning which is integral to your success in the data science and machine learning career paths.
2) You get used to sharing your work, something that can help you to create many opportunities for yourself.
3) The community holds you accountable. This is often the missing piece for many people looking to learn these skills.

nUOh_lDMHOU,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"This is Part 6 of the Data Science Project from Scratch Series. In this video I put the salary prediction model that I made in part 5 into production using flask. We make an API endpoint that takes in job posting data and returns an expected salary. 

Article By Chris that we Followed to Create the API: https://towardsdatascience.com/productionize-a-machine-learning-model-with-flask-and-heroku-8201260503d2

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

For data science projects, model production is not required, but it can separate you from the pack. It shows that you understand how other people could use your model, and you have made it into a product for them. 

I recommend turning a model into an API endpoint or a small web page at least once for your portfolio. 

Stay tuned for part 7 of this series where I make a github readme for this project.

Data science is collaborative, when working from home it is harder to solve problems with your peers.

Work also blends into your personal life. This can be challenging for work / life balance.

You have to be very proactive in scheduling if you want to be effective.

It is hard to get help from co-workers who are not near by.

NFT’s or non-fungible tokens, had a massive year last year. There were over $14 billion dollars in sales on the largest marketplace for these digital assets, OpenSea. There is very little regulation if any on what is a legitimate project or not. Unfortunately, this has led to some major scams, pump and dumps and otherwise unethical practices. My friend Avery Smith and I didn’t like that people could be getting taken advantage of from a system like this. We wanted to see if data could be used to help solve this problem. 

Could we use our data science skills to understand the nature of whales in the NFT space, if projects are legitimate or scams, and create a framework for more transparency on a platform like OpenSea.

Find out what I learned about AI's takeover of this space. Have you already seen this happening in your interactions with companies?

B1g_yMKpdwo,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 10 (Leveraging Your Data),"In this video, I review one of Isac's data science projects and his resume. He has an incredibly unique project where he analyzes his own Spotify data to try to predict which songs he would like. This is a great example of a unique project that employers would be looking for. 

Project 
- Include details into the dataset. Employers want to know how you collected the data and some insights about the features if they are not clear
- Explain decision points in your analysis. Isac does this well when he explains why he uses 15 listens as a threshold for a liked song
- Explain your evaluation criteria. Isac weights training time very heavily in this analysis, he should explain why this is important if it is relevant 

Resume
- Put skills at the top 
- Start with outcomes and follow up with methods and tools used

Strokes gained is a normalized metric that allows us to compare type of shot apples to apples. They are compared using fractions of strokes. This is very similar to how wins above replacement is used in baseball.

Strokes gained is also an aggregated / normalized metric. In order to get strokes gained, we compare each shot, hole, round, and tournament to the average. If a player shoots 72 and the average score for the day is 73, then they have +1 strokes gained on the round. Players who play better than average should always have positive total strokes gained and players who perform worse than average should always have negative strokes gained total.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

WslmhWukJdM,UCLLw7jmFsvfIVaUFsLs8mlQ,Luke Barousse,Python Functions for Data Science / Data Analysis - P.5,"Python Fundamentals Course (DataCamp) 👉🏼 https://lukeb.co/PythonBasicsDataCamp
Data Analyst Track w/ Python (DataCamp) 👉🏼 https://lukeb.co/PythonAnalystDataCamp
(My recommended courses that I took to learn Python!)

This video provides an overview of how data scientists and data analysts frequently use function.  We start with understanding the use case for functions and then take a look at Python's built-in functions.  We then spend the majority of the time covering how to build functions and more complex aspects of functions, like the unpacking operator (*, **).  Finally, we apply what we learn to build a function that counts the lines of specified actors from 'The Office' CSV dataset.

Data science projects payoff in multiple ways. First, they help you learn data science in an extremely efficient way. With projects you are able to narrow the gigantic scope of data science down to a single problem. 

Next, data science projects can pay off by helping you to land a job. You gain valuable, real world, experience by doing these. You also showcase some skills that are difficult to manifest through your more traditional work. In addition to experience, you also have a portfolio to showcase that can have employers reaching out to you rather than you chasing them down all the time. 

Finally, data science projects can pay off financially. Many projects can turn into products, content, or companies. My own youtube channel actually started off by a project that I did.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Is the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate right for you? This certificate program from Coursera is advertised to be able to get you a job as a data analyst without a degree.  To answer the initial question we must first understand your options for becoming a data analyst.  For this, I cover the differences and job opportunities for degrees & certificates.

None of my friends were in this field and I really only had myself to push me and figure out what to learn. Over the course of the past 3 years I have learned more than I ever thought possible. I am now a data analyst at a Fortune 500 company making over 100k and it seems a bit surreal. I have a lot more aspirations for my career and I hold myself a little higher knowing I worked incredibly hard to be where I am now.

You're trying to convince someone to hire you even though you're really just starting out. I found it really tough and very competitive to try to get my first job. I hope this can help someone who is going through the same thing and give some insight into what I went through and what I did to land my first job as a Data Analyst.

This isn't all about me, they have also been gracious in giving away gear and deep learning credits to you (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee). 

They will be giving away a few of these products later this year, so make sure to stay tuned with my twitter, linkedin, and youtube to figure out how you can land one. I will also be working with them to find a way to give away some of this hardware exclusively to my subscribers!

**In Loving Memory of Coach Tyler Wall**

It is with profound sadness that we share the unexpected passing of Coach Tyler Wall. Coach Wall was a remarkable individual whose kindness and genuine spirit touched all who knew him. His loss has left our hearts heavy with grief.

Following this tragic news, we reached out to Coach Wall’s family to determine whether this video should be shared. With grace and wisdom, they expressed that Tyler would have wanted his message of hope and positivity to continue reaching others, even in his absence.

We humbly ask that you honor Coach Wall’s memory and respect his family’s need for privacy during this difficult time.

Coach Tyler Wall’s legacy of compassion and encouragement will live on in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to know him.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

nrEJGGxcoTc,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Is your phone REALLY listening to you? This video is my take based on my experience as a data scientist. 

Most of us have had the experience where we are talking with a friend about a product or idea and it eerily pops up as an advertisement on our favorite social media platform. It makes us feel uncomfortable like our privacy was violated. Was our phone listening to us? In this video I will give my take on this as a data professional, what is really happening, and what we can do about it if anything. 

They are listening, but mostly when you want them to be. Tools like siri, alexa, and google are obviously listening. However, they likely aren't tracking everything you say. This is for 2 main reasons.
1) Tracking all this would be storage and processing intensive
2) It would be unbelievably bad PR 

How are they so good at predicting then? 
1) They track our online behaviors and the actions of the people we communicate with regularly 
2) Cognitive bias. We see a LOT of ads each day and we don't realize it

_K6cNdgN3CI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 4 (Resume & Github),"In this video I go through and review a resume and project portfolio of one of my subscribers. I talk about some of the ways that this data science resume could be improved to be more appealing to recruiters and employers. I also go through the various projects in this person's resume and talk about how he could improve upon them. 

Special thanks to Kinjal for letting me review his resume and portfolio. 

Data science Resume advice:
- Keep your resume to 1 page 
- Remove extraneous details that are subjective. Only keep hard technical skills in those respective sections 
- Use action verbs to describe your experience 
- Order the sections by what the recruiters care about most 

Data Science Project Portfolio Tips:
- Do personal projects where you collect your own data
- Use the Readme file to describe your work
- Comment your code as much as possible

Keep getting rejected from data analyst, data scientist, or data engineering roles? In this video I break down the 5 biggest reasons why people get rejected. If you turn these around you can dramatically increase your chances of landing your next position! 

(1) You aren't capitalizing on supply and demand dynamics
(2) You aren't treating the job hunting process like a data problem
(3) You aren't looking for data jobs in the right places
(4) You aren't networking your you're networking correctly 
(5) Your data science portfolio is holding you back

In this video we will dive into some of the new features that will come with Microsoft Fabric.

There is a lot of tools and services that will be packaged in this platform so I won't dive into things like Azure Data Factory, Warehousing, and other already existing products. I will be focusing mostly on the new features that will come with Fabric.

Creating content, my data science job, and relaxation, are in a constant battle for my attention. This is a typical (hopefully interesting) day. 

In this video I keep track of how much time I allocate to each activity. You also see how a small change of plans can derail my whole day. Overall, this was a pretty successful day by my standards. Here's to more of those!

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

PU6UCZve6tM,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,"After testing hundreds of AI tools, here’s what I wish more people knew","Here’s what I wish more people knew about AI: 

1. Knowing prompt engineering skills can save you A LOT of money. If you can get your desired output through prompting you can often skip the costly subscriptions and specialized AI products.
2. Demos ARE NOT products. They usually only show a singular, limited use case that has not been battle tested with various inputs.
3. Many AI tools seem to do the same thing which can be confusing. Multiple companies make AI tools such as chatbots, agent builders, vibe coding tools, etc. that seem to do similar things but each have specific strengths, use cases and skill levels. The right one really comes down to your specific use cases. For example, n8n can be used for no code agent implementation while OpenAI agents SDK is a coded implementation, although both are used for building agentic workflows.
4. Evals are SUPER important for building AI Agents. My latest video goes into this more!",2025-06-24T15:59:12Z,[],18168,373,10,PT14S,hd,false,public,True,False

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

HJH0gfY6EUg,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"In this video I go through and review a resume and project portfolio of one of my subscribers. I talk about some of the ways that this data science resume could be improved to be more appealing to recruiters and employers. I also go through the various projects in this person's resume and talk about how he could improve upon them. 

Special thanks to Mohamed for letting me review his resume and portfolio. Link to his profile here: https://github.com/zeglam/Countries-GDP-prediction

Data Science Project Portfolio Tips:
- Check spelling and grammar in your workbooks
- Include distribution visuals 
- If you don't collect your own data for a project, make up for it by going more in depth on the exploratory analysis

r-DR9HBaipU,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"In this 3 part series, I walk you through how I approach a data science project, specifically a kaggle competition. You will get to see me work through the kaggle developer survey kaggle competition from start to finish. 

In Part 1 I show you how I: 
- Join the competition
- Read through the documentation
- Understand the evaluation criteria
- Download the data (good video on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkEbaMgvLs8&ab_channel=DecisionForest)
- Review other people's kaggle kernels 
- Frame the questions that I want to ask of the data 

In Part 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ80oD_boBM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=KenJee)  I will use some different tools to visualize some of the data 

In Part 3 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO420aMtHfk&ab_channel=KenJee) I will seek to answer some of the questions that I have posed in Part 1 and Part 2

I haven't done any sports analytics content in a while, so I thought it would be fun to make this video about how I used machine learning to fill out my NCAA Basketball tournament bracket. 

I walk you through the 5 different models that I use. 2 machine learning based, 1 simulation based, 1 Elo rating based, and 1 based purely off of seed. I also made some pretty cool tools that can help you see how everything works under the hood. 

Hopefully next year I will finish my analysis before the tournament actually starts so you can use the tools that I build.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

It's hard to design an effective and efficient self study plan and I argue even harder to actually stick with it. It's common to fall into the trap of buying other people's study plans and then giving up. Or falling into tutorial hell and giving up. Or feel frustrated because you feel like you're running around in circles and not seeing progress and giving up. Basically, it's really really easy to give up. So in this video, I'm going to share with you guys 8 crucial ingredients that I incorporate into my study plans. The first 5 is for designing the study plan and the last 3 are to make sure that I actually stick with it. 

There you have it: how I design effective study plans and stick with them!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Haha a lot of people just assume that if you get into a FAANG you can just lead a relaxing lifestyle. I'm not complaining but just wanted to show y'all what a work day can look like. It's of course not always like this but it's also not a rarity. 

I hope you guys enjoy this vlog, where I also document me working on a new nlp project in collab with Ken Jee :) Please let me know if you want to see more vlogs! Suggestions always welcome!

yAwG8DoTmjI,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,"How to self study using MOOCS (Udemy, Coursera, and other online courses) | self study online","Hi friends! In this video, I go in depth on how to self study online using online courses and how to not give up like a third of the way in. If you have bought online courses and just never actuallly finished them, you are not alone. An average of only 10% of people actually finish an online course. And I was the 90% too before I developed and went through the process that I talk about in this video.

Be warned, this is a thorough discussion that isn't just tips and tricks - it's going to involve some introspection from you as well. I promise it's worth it though.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

oHUD2T_VXfI,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"In this video I review Darwin's project portfolio. This is truly is job-worthy. This github style is a little different than the ones I have done in the past. Darwin uses a single folder structure that is very organized rather than having all of his projects in different repos. This is a totally fine approach and it clearly worked well for him.

Take Aways:
- Great data science project overviews. Simple for a recruiter to understand 
- Clear sense of order in the folder structure
- Excellent and detailed documentation 
- TLDR is a nice touch 
- ReadMe files in each folder is not something I have seen frequently used 
- Clear why data science projects are relevant to him
- Did research (great work experience)
- Showcased tableau experience (great for showing business knowledge)

In this video I'm going to talk about everything concerning AI as it pertains to Analytics. The good, the bad, and where I think it will be in 5+ years. 

I understand this is a sensitive topic and not everyone is going to agree with my viewpoint, but hopefully this will open up a discussion around these things where we can dive into it more as a community.

FqNpDNmpcEo,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Zillow was leading the tech revolution in real estate. How could they make a $500,000,000 mistake in the hottest market in real estate history. Was this a problem with the Machine Learning Model they were using (the Zestimate), or something even more concerning? 

To be clear, the opinions expressed in this video are my own and based on what I think happened with Zillow. I only have access to public news articles and data, so this is all speculation. 

0:00 Zillow Starting Strong
1:15 What is Zillow Offers?
2:37 $500,000,000 Loss
3:14 What is the Zestimate Really?
4:45 Is the Machine Learning Model at Fault?
7:15 How Did It Get Out of Hand?
9:55 Is Machine Learning Evil?

In 2018 Zillow was riding high. They were dominating the real-estate marketplace with a digital tech offering. Their CEO, Rich Barton, had a wild idea. Could he use the estimates that they were generating to buy houses at under market value, fix them up, and then sell them for a profit. There were a lot of positives for this plan, first, home buying can be difficult. For the seller, buying directly through Zillow could be almost as simple as a click of a button, especially if they were getting a decent price for the house. You also could avoid many of the closing costs & additional fees with a third-party realtor. 

They already had a the zestimate system to evaluate housing prices. Could they just take that a step further and use that for real buying decisions? The company seemed to think so. That same year they started Zillow Offers, this platform would essentially make instantaneous offers on properties. This practice is known now as iBuying. 

By October of this year, Zillow disclosed that it wrote down over 500 million dollars of losses do to houses that were purchased at too high a price through the 3rd and 4th quarter of the year.

1) The Zestimate wasn't used as it was initially intended. Did the company make the necessary changes to leverage it for buying houses?
2) House flipping was very different from the transactions the CEO has been used to. This new market has distinct differences from previous machine learning projects he has worked on
3) A volatile market is a bad time to test a model 
4) Greed and poor incentives appear to have crept into decision making

cnqTU6eJwH0,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Roasting My First Data Science Project (Common Project Mistakes),"In this video I walk through my first data science project experience! It wasn't easy but I think I made the most of it. Hopefully you can learn from the mistakes I made when you start your first project or any subsequent one! 

My first open ended data science project was given to me during grad school. I had to find a dataset, build a model, and predict an outcome. I thought this was going to be easy... but boy was I wrong. 

The first challenge that I ran into is that I couldn't decide on a topic. I kept finding datasets, jumping into analysis and then getting stuck. I learned that I need to start with defining a problem before jumping right into the data.

After I finally settled on a problem, my results were really disappointing. I was too focused on optimizing my models than analyzing WHY I was getting these bad results. 

Finally, I got through the ""hard stuff"" and threw together a presentation. I ended up getting all of my points deducted because my presentation stunk. I would later learn that all of my analysis was worthless if I couldn't clearly explain it.

f6NPw582FFc,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,"One of my greatest passions outside of data science is cooking. Surprisingly, the steps to making a new meal are almost identical to that of a data science project. I love this cooking analogy because it is extremely simple and non-technical people understand it well. 

Medium Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-explained-with-cooking-1a801731d749

1) Buying ingredients = Data collection
2) Cleaning produce = Data cleaning
3) Cutting, Peeling, Etc. = Feature engineering 
4) Tasting = Data exploration 
5) Cooking method = Algorithm selection
6) Temp & time = Model tuning 
7) Sharing meal = Cross validation
8) Recipe = Productionization 
9) Customer Experience = API Endpoint

Data science takes a significant amount of time and effort to learn. You need to understand computer science, math, and various different platforms. I distilled these tips from a few different books that I have read over the years.

Books:
4 disciplines of execution: https://amzn.to/2nJqsDw Sean Covey

3) Stay accountable by keeping score and relying on your peers
4) Schedule your entire day including your down time 
5) Design your workplace to optimize for quality work

q6Lf2yhvluw,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),"In this video, I review Alexander's Data Science Website Portfolio, Data Science Resume, Projects, and LinkedIn Profile. 

Alexander has some of the most in-depth data science projects I've seen. These are great case studies for anyone looking to up their game. 

Links Mentioned
My Resume: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsXWVPzwZPk
Tina's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww
Danny's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYPQz_qySbPESTK8k2ky5g
Alexander's Website: https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/

Portfolio:
- Very nice web layout
- Maybe keep it to one scrollable page
- Love the about me, perfect place to put it and cute dog
- Cool to see someone pursuing this career after going back to school
- Key thing is he is transitioning, not jumping
- No age for data science

Resume 
- I like the digital resume, but maybe a pdf or picture of a traditional one would make more sense here
- I don't love the *** scale. For me this is usually a box to check (Can he do this, we will find out his aptitude later) One thing I've found is that people have no clue how to judge their own ability
- More expansion on the types of skills
- Love how he talks about his projects and what he is doing
- Don't see a need for the soft skills section

Linkedin 
- More connections
- Share work here

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

How does Python perform on the new M1 Mac compared to the Intel mac? For this I evaluate functionality, package support, and speed.  When evaluating functionality and package support on the M1 mac I use python running through rosetta (as packages are fully supported through this).  When evaluating speed I also include tests for python running natively on the M1 chip (this version doesn't fully support packages yet)

LinkedIn is a great place to connect with other professionals and find jobs. I have personally been able to find jobs through LinkedIn and today I want to share my tips on how to best do that!

Recruiter Template:
""Hi (Recruiter). My name is (Name) and I’m a (Title). If you have a second, I would love the chance to discuss how my (Specific Skill) and experiences might match the (Job Title) that I saw posted on LinkedIn. Thanks for connecting and I hope you have a great day!""

Referral Template:
""Hello (Person's First Name). My name is (Name) and I saw there was a job opening at your company for a (Job Title) position. I believe I would be a great fit and would love it if you would be able to be a referral for the position. I've attached my resume so you can see some of my skills and experience.

1.NotebookLM: has a super generous free tier and is really powerful for taking large amount of information and sources and distilling them in easy and digestible ways. I use it to do research and write script for my videos, but also to learn really complex technical skills quickly. The podcast feature is one of my favorites!
2.Firebase Studio: a great AI app building tool with another really generous free tier (NotebookLM and Firebase Studio are both Google products)! If you're trying to build an AI app, I highly recommend you try Firebase Studio before other more expensive options.
3.HeyGen + ElevenLabs: here's a little secret... sometime when I have a small ~5 second section of recording missing from one of my videos, I just use HeyGen to clone my avatar and ElevenLabs to clone my voice and fill in the gap. It's an amazing and underrated comb for content creators! It's not 100% yet, but the trick is to only do this with very small sections of video (until it improves, which is happening fast). These both have free tiers you could use to try it out.

My latest YT upload dives into ALL the 🆓 tools from Google that you can start using right now without having to commit your credit card. Link is in the bio for more!",2025-10-10T07:13:16Z,[],24966,510,23,PT10S,hd,false,public,True,False

txR8_jGi0Ls,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 7 (Incredible Portfolio Website),"In this video I go through Pranav's data science portfolio, resume and projects. Pranav has previously worked as a software engineer, and he has one of the more complete github profiles and portfolio websites that I have seen. He has done an awesome job so far, but there are still a few minor tweaks that I think could help him to improve his job prospects.

I think that this video will help others to understand how even excellent portfolios could be improved. 

Website advice:
- Make things as easy as possible for recruiters (try to keep everything on one page)
- Use a website as an opportunity to go into more depth than your resume, but less depth than your github readme
- If you have many github projects, use the portfolio website to call out the most important ones for the data science positions you are applying for 

Data Science Resume:
- Put your technical skills up top
- Pranav does a great job with his job descriptions here

Why Data vis is important for these roles 
1) It helps us to understand our data 
2) It allows us to easily track and analyze the performance of our models 
3) We can create self service tools for business stakeholders 
4) It is efficient for conveying relevant info to business stakeholders
5) Data visualization inspires action.

It reminded me of all the cool applications of data and sports analytics in golf. In this video I talk about how the golf industry is leveraging data and technology to improve the enjoyment of the game. 

1) Launch monitors and golf simulators. These technologies allow us to very closely estimate what happens to the golf ball after it is hit. They allow us to play virtual golf with real clubs and balls. 
2) Golf club companies. A few companies are using Machine Learning and AI to test and refine their club making practices.
3) Golf Operations Technologies allow golf courses to benchmark merchandise, food, and staffing. 
4) The measurement of body physiology throughout the golf swing 
5) Platforms for sports betting and fantasy sports

This was something I hadn't heard before a few weeks ago, but slowly I started hearing more about it and seeing it all over my LinkedIn and Facebook feeds. I decided to look into it to see if it was something that I should be concerned about or if it was just another do it yourself product.

GO420aMtHfk,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),"Notebook 1: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/kaggle-project-from-scratch
Notebook 2: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/analyzing-gender-and-earning-potential-in-tech

I do two main analyses in this video. First, I look build more advanced graphs to compare differences in skills and characteristics across data science roles using the kaggle developer survey data. I then create a function to make this task more scalable.

In the second part of the video, I use a few different techniques to determine if there is gender bias in data science particularly relating to salary. 

In the notebook I:
- First visualize and normalize gender differences in the sample
- Run a multiple linear regression to understand which factors contribute most to earning potential
- Run a lasso regression to narrow variable set and try to quantify the extent gender impacts earning potential
- Run a random forest on same data to evaluate feature importance (A nonlinear model like this is a good check)
- Compare models for just subsets of women and men to hopefully normalize for more variables

#DataScience #DataScienceJobs #DataScienceInternship
Highlights:
- Plan your resume carefully, put your tech skills up top and highlight your project experience. Try to do multiple projects, one for regression, one for classification, one for clustering, and one using either deep learning or gradient boosted random forest. Also, customize your resume and message for each interview.
- Practice telling your story. Know why you want to work as a data scientist and why you want to work at a specific company. do your homework on company news and history. This can get you to the next round.
- Don't freak out over a coding interview or a problem analysis set. Companies don't expect too much from interns. They just want to know that you have baseline abilities. If you want to impress them, use an ensemble model or use some feature engineering. 
- In person, speak about the outcomes of your projects. Make sure you communicate why you worked on them and the potential value they could create for a business.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

There are plenty of cases where data science could make sense for you. Below are three situations where data science won't be a good fit for you. 


1) You are in it for the money
2) You don't like autonomy 
3) You are uncomfortable with collaboration

Data science is an awesome field, but it isn't for everyone. You should not become a data scientist if the three pillars above are relevant to you!

Its estimated he made close to $1 Billion betting on horses in Hong Kong. His story is well documented, but the models he used and the reasons for his success are often overlooked.

This can be stack overflow, google, code docs, past code etc. Very little data science is done by sitting in front of a computer and just coding. Data science is iterative and little of it comes directly from your brain to the computer. 

Great data scientists aren't the best coders or the best at math, they are the people that know where to look for information and apply it the most effectively. It may be a little disappointing, but even at the lowest levels of data science you can begin to understand how to search for the data that you want. 

Many data scientists also will have a source code document that they refer to on almost all of their projects. This saves them time and effort so they can focus on the real problem solving.

IoUWD1h6xUs,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,A Quick Data Science Project Tip! #SHORTS,"#DataScience #KenJee #SHORT

You don’t need to do a completely novel analysis or use brand new data to differentiate your projects. Sometimes, a great story will do as much or more than these to get you noticed. 

Rather think jumping straight into an analysis, think about who the analysis is for. Working with the titanic dataset has completely new meaning if you are analyzing it to understand risk for an insurance company looking to cover another large ship. An analysis of the iris dataset comes to life if your customer is the largest flower shop in new York trying to reduce costs by identifying pickable flowers with machine learning. 

These are the most boring and common projects you can do, but they have become exciting by envisioning the customer and the story associated with them. 

If you want to stand out, add these elements to your projects and talk about them in story form on your resume and in your interviews. 
This was a short video, so do me a favor and watch it again. While you’re watching, think about who the target of your most recent project is and how you could tell a great story about it.

In this video, I talk about what a portfolio is, explain who benefits the most from having one, and go in depth about how to structure one and what to put in it. You can get started and create your own portfolio and/or website by clicking this *link: http://www.wix.com/TinaHuangWix. 

Throughout the video, I’ll also be showing you guys my portfolio website that I created using wix, who is also the sponsor of this video. Link: https://www.hellotinah.com

More about Wix:

About me 


Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

I think this is an incredible accomplishment. In this interview, we carefully go through how he learned the data analyst skills, how he applied for his role, and how he succeeded in through the interview process. 

This interview will be useful for anyone looking to break into the field of data analytics and data science. Although, it is very rare to break into the field at this speed, Ray's story shows that it can be done!

Z_KFh-HqaBA,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,I Wish I Had Known THIS Before Starting in Data Science,"I talk about the things that I wish I had known before I started down the data science career path. 

1) Data wrangling is a bigger part of the job than many expect. Learn SQL and be efficient with manipulating data in Python or R.

2) You don't always get to work on projects that are exciting to you. In school you choose many of the data sets and projects that you do. Almost universally, at work, your day to day projects are dictated by your boss.

3) You can learn a tremendous amount from other people. Data Scientists are incredibly smart and come from a range of backgrounds. 

4) Data science is constantly growing. With the field being broadly defined, there is almost a limitless amount of things to learn.

5) Office politics do play a role in data science. If you are interested in management after data science, it could be good to know who makes the strategic decisions. 

6) Data science is very different at different companies depending on the size and growth phase of the organization.

7) Put some time into learning implementation frameworks (Docker & Sagemaker)

8) Statistical significance plays a different role in the business setting. If the expected value is positive, you should at least try it.

🤖 Want to get ahead in your career using AI? Join the waitlist for my AI Agent Bootcamp: https://www.lonelyoctopus.com/ai-agent-bootcamp

I tested every no-code AI agent builder so you don’t have to.
 From StackAI and Relevance AI to n8n, Flowise, Lindy, and Dify, this video breaks down the best platforms to create AI agents — without writing a single line of code.

You’ll learn:
 ⚙️ The core features and ideal use cases of each builder
 🧩 How each platform handles automation, API integration, and LLM workflows
 📈 When to use visual tools vs workflow orchestrators
 💡 The difference between automations and dynamic agents — and why it matters
 🚀 The easiest way to go from idea → AI agent → deployed product

We’ll explore:

StackAI for general-purpose agents and API publishing
Relevance AI for scalable workflows
n8n for powerful orchestration & branching logic
Flowise / Langflow for open-source prompt engineering
Dify and Lindy for hybrid and business automation
Botpress, Bubble, Make, MindStudio, and more

By the end, you’ll know exactly which no-code agent builder fits your workflow.

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

(My recommended courses that I took to learn Python!)

This video provides an overview of if statements and how they are used by data scientist / data analysts.  Additionally, we cover operators used within if statements such as: Comparison (==, !=), Logical (and, or, not), Identity (is), and Membership (in).  At the end we build a simple chatbot with what we have learned, to provide feedback on characters from 'The Office'.

Also, if curious, here is more on operator precedence 👉🏼 https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence

00:00 Introduction
00:46 If Statement - Basic if statement
02:19 If Statement - else condition
02:59 If Statement - elif condition
04:16 Comparison Operators - ==, !=
06:13 Logical Operators - and, or, not
08:15 Membership Operators - in
09:11 Identity Operators - is

o-wsyxWbPOw,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I recently took the LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.  In this video I explain why an assessment like this from a big company like LinkedIn is a major problem. 

First, I don't think you can properly assess machine learning aptitude in 15 questions at 1 minute and 30 seconds for each question. 

What purpose does this assessment really serve? It doesn't help an applicant show anything meaningful about their machine learning skills. It doesn't help recruiters or hiring managers help evaluate talent. If anything, this just floods the market with another useless certification. 

I think that LinkedIn should either abandon this all together, or make it something that they use as part of their hiring criteria. This is what google did with their google analytics certification and it gained massive popularity and credibility.

I think that APIs are one of the most underrated tools that data scientists use or implement. 

Check out Tiff's Channel: @TiffInTech

Her Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tiffintech?lang=en

Some awesome public APIs: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
My Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee

Why are APIs important for data scientists? 
1) Great way to access new data or build consistency around a data pipeline
2) One of the most efficient ways to share our models or findings with software engineers or other data scientists 
3) Leveraging pre built models so we don't have to do rework 

How to use API's  - All apis are a little bit different, but most of the times you send a request to the API endpoint. With that request you can either receive back data or a service, or request that the api makes a change to the system that it is attached to.

How to create APIs - APIs consist mostly of a web server forwarding on a process to another application. You can build an api by creating a web server in flask, fast api, or other libraries and hosting it on the cloud.

iPdO9MwdcLE,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,What Professional Data Scientists ACTUALLY Do,"Sign up or learn more about SharpestMinds here: https://www.sharpestminds.com?r=ken-jee

We often see the best parts of being a data scientist in day of the life videos. In this one I tell you what the whole experience is like. I want to talk to you about what data scientists ACTUALLY do, not about just the fun parts of the job. 

1) There is no one size fits all data science job. You can find what you want out of the variety of opportunities in the domain 
2) Project management for data science is a real thing, you're going to have to get familiar with the tools of the trade to have a good experience 
3) Different types of projects have different expectations. You have dramatically different responsibilities if you're working on long term or ad hoc data science projects 
4) Git and versioning is a must learn for working with data science teams 
5)  Learning to work with production and development servers is a big difference from personal projects
6) Tools and languages you use vary dramatically by team
7) Work is not always as exciting as you expect, your main responsibility is to drive value to the business 
8) Ambiguity is a major part of the role
9) Not everyone loves data scientists in your organization 
10) You sit down a lot 
11) You get to work on mostly interesting projects
12) You are surrounded by learning and opportunities to expand your knowledge 
13) Work / Life balance is usually pretty good 

I got the idea for this video from my friend @fknight . His video on what professional software developers actually do (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0A35ZfgwHA)  was a great take, and I thought that this could potentially be even more relevant for the data science domain.

Uf0dO-pgOrk,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"In this video I will talk about my own doubts and insecurities when it comes to the field. I will also give you a look into I was able to leverage these feelings into something positive.

Data science is a field filled with doubt. Not all of the problems we tackle have answers, not all of our models will be successful. I would argue that in truth we fail more than we succeed. This has given rise to impostor syndrome.

Real world data science is almost the opposite of academia. In school most people succeed more than they fail. They are used to getting high marks routinely. They aren’t used to only passing a class half of the time.  I think that this conditioning makes it difficult for us to accept failure when it comes more frequently like it does in data science. And Failure can come almost 98% of the time if we are talking about job applications…

rd1HKwJT6GM,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,Upenn MCIT Program Details and Real Student Experiences - Dr. Arvind Bhusnurmath,"Hi everyone, I'm so excited to share this video with anyone that is interested in MCIT at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) or even currently enrolled! This video is a deep dive into MCIT and goes beyond all the stats you can find already online. Arvind and I talk about real experiences of real students and he gives amazing insights into what MCIT is about and if you are someone that should really dedicate yourself to this program. Arvind is not only the director of MCIT, professor, and my past boss (I was a TA for one of his classes), but also an incredible mentor and human being. He's honest, extremely intelligent, caring, and humble (sorry Arvind I know I'm probably embarrassing you haha). I was worried that this interview-style video is too long, but I decided to do very minimal editing and just post it because I think it's just so valuable. I added timestamps though so please feel free to skip around! I really hope you enjoy it and find it useful :)

vy-R4oUZaC8,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,Ken Jee,Data Science Project Example Start to Finish (Deep Learning Image Classifier),"In this video I do a Complete Data Science Project Example from start to finish. This is the type of project that you could put in your portfolio or on your resume. 

I have been asked quite a bit to do an end-to-end data science project. This is a simple project that leverages deep learning for image classification. Data science projects don't all have to be overwhelmingly difficult and take a tremendous amount of time. Something like this, that produces a good solution to an interesting problem are just as valuable. 

For this project I use google collab and fastai for the deep learning portion. These tools make it easy to do a deep learning project and get dependable results. fastai is built on top of pytorch, and abstracts away many of the overly complex parts of deep learning. I highly recommend their free MOOC, linked below. 

In this project, we use a convolutional neural net (CNN), that was trained on the resnet dataset. With this, we can use transfer learning to produce a good result with little additional training.

Resume 
- Keep the data science resume to a single page. For an entry level position, if it is longer than this it will be discarded.
- Put your skills up top
- For education and work experience, start with your most recent activities 
- Data science projects should be quantified as much as possible 

Git Hub Portfolio 
- Great to have a github header with your information (Thinam did this really well)
- Include links to linkedin & twitter if yours is professional 
- Keep readme's consistent. The more organized your repos are, the better 

Linkedin Data Science Advice 
- Interact with the community through sharing posts and commenting 
- Use the About me section to tell your story
- Endorse others and ask for endorsements 
- GO more into depth about your experience
